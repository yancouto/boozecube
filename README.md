# How to use

1. Download [Magic Set Editor](https://magicseteditor.boards.net/)
2. Put everything inside the `put_these_inside_data_folder` inside the... you guessed it, `data` folder.
3. Open the `Magic - Fonts` folder, select all fonts (non-template-specific) in there, right click and select `Install`.
4. Run MSE and open the `boozecube.mse-set` file.
