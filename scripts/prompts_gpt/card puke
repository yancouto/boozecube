ChatGPT prompt: Create Magic: The Gathering card art with a humorous, lighthearted style. The split card is titled "Puke // Rally." For "Puke," show a cartoonish scene of a disoriented partygoer, slightly green in the face, clutching their stomach, while empty cups litter the groundâ€”capture a silly, chaotic party vibe. For "Rally," shift to a hopeful scene with the same character now refreshed, looking determined and standing tall amid rallied friends, all cheering and ready for action. Use bright, exaggerated expressions and keep the art playful, conveying both the folly and the comeback. Styled like classic Magic cards from the late '90s, with visible brush strokes and a vibrant palette.
