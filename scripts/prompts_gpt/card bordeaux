A whimsical Magic the Gathering card titled "Bordeaux," depicting a murky, enchanted vineyard at twilight with twisting grapevines emerging from the ground like swamp tendrils, wine glasses half-submerged in shadowy pools, a gothic atmosphere with hints of purple and black, eerie but inviting, in the style of simple, clean illustration, credited to sasasasa.
