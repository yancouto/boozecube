Create a Magic: The Gathering card illustration for "Motion-Sensor-Bomb," an enchantment Aura Curse. The artwork should be simple and clear: depict a spectral, glowing bomb delicately hovering just above the back of a person's hand, pulsing with energy, with faint magical auras and glyphs swirling around it. The person's hand should be shown in focus against a neutral, unobtrusive background, emphasizing the tense, precarious balance of the bomb. The overall tone should feel tense and suspenseful, matching the sense of imminent danger.
