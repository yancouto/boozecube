A lighthearted Magic: The Gathering enchantment card called “Common Courtesy,” featuring a whimsical scene of a wizard in flowing robes standing with arms crossed, blocking the way of another frustrated mage trying to cast a spell, while speech bubbles float above them—one reading "May I?" and the other "No!"—with a table in the background holding a drink, set in a simple, cartoon-like style to emphasize the playful, rule-enforcing theme of manners and permission.
