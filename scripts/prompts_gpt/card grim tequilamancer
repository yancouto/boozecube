Describe a Magic: The Gathering card illustration for "Grim Tequilamancer," depicting a gaunt human shaman in tattered robes, clutching a bottle filled with glowing, mystical tequila, standing in a graveyard at dusk. Wisps of green energy spiral from the bottle toward tombstones, infusing a shadowy, spectral creature with power. The scene is moody and mysterious, with earthy colors, and the shamanâ€™s expression is wild and intense. Simple, clear art style with a touch of dark humor.
