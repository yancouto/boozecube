Create the art for a Magic The Gathering card called "Rum Elemental," depicting a whimsical, swirling elemental spirit made of amber rum, with wisps of liquid and vapor forming its body and wings to indicate flying; it hovers playfully above a table scattered with empty glasses and bottles, exuding a mischievous, intoxicating aura, in a simple, lighthearted fantasy style.
