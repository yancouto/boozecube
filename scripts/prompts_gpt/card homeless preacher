A weathered, ragged man with a wild, prophetic gaze stands on a street corner, clutching a worn holy book and gesturing passionately as though preaching to an indifferent city. Tattered robes and mismatched layers hint at hardship, while his surroundings—a littered sidewalk, flickering streetlamp, and distant neon lights—frame his solitary figure. Style is gritty and realistic, with somber, muted colors evoking urban struggle and a touch of mysticism.
