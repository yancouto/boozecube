Create a Magic: The Gathering card illustration for "Ale Koâ€™u Kai," a powerful Avatar creature. Depict a looming, ethereal figure with Hawaiian-inspired features, standing on the shoreline with swirling sea foam and crashing waves. The Avatar exudes a mysterious, mystical presence, with subtle aquatic motifs and an imposing, yet tranquil expression. The art should be naturalistic and detailed, focusing on the sense of ancient, oceanic power.
