A whimsical Magic The Gathering card illustration showing a clumsy figure stumbling, spilling a drink, and beginning to rise up again, as magical energy swirls around them; in the background, a ghostly creature fades away and reappears, now glowing with a faint light and empowered. The scene combines a playful and ephemeral mood, fitting for an instant spell with a touch of humor and transformation.
