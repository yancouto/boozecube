A slightly disheveled young human wizard, robes untidy and eyes glazed with intoxication, wobbles unsteadily in a stone hallway lit by flickering torchlight; he clumsily conjures a tiny flame in his palm, a mischievous grin on his face, with scattered magical books and empty bottles at his feetâ€”simple, humorous Magic: The Gathering art style.
