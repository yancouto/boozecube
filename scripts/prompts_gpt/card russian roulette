A whimsical Magic The Gathering card titled "Russian Roulette," depicting a chaotic table scene where raucous goblins gather around a magical six-chamber revolver. One goblin nervously prepares to pull the trigger while others cheer, steins of frothy beer raised high. The atmosphere is tense yet playful, with enchanted dice and scattered playing cards glowing in warm candlelight; bold, straightforward colors and design, playful but slightly edgy.
