Create Magic: The Gathering card art for "Stoned Lich"â€”a skeletal lich with glowing eyes, slumped lazily on a throne of rough-hewn stone, wreathed in wisps of smoke. The room is dimly lit, littered with empty potion bottles and enchanted goblets, suggesting an atmosphere of magical intoxication and apathy. The lich wears tattered robes and has a bemused, vacant expression, as mystical runes glow faintly in the air around it. The overall mood is both eerie and comically lethargic, with the palette leaning towards smoky grays, muted purples, and sickly greens.
