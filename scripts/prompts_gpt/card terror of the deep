Create the art for a Magic: The Gathering card named "Terror of the Deep", a legendary Kraken creature. Depict an immense, shadowy kraken bursting from the dark ocean depths under a stormy sky, its massive tentacles swirling and churning the water. The kraken dominates the scene while below it, the surface teems with silhouette shapes representing face-down, indistinct creatures, suggesting their power hidden beneath mystery. The overall tone should be ominous and powerful, with a realistic, detailed style.
