Create artwork for a Magic: The Gathering card named "Social Chair," depicting a Vedalken Fratboy creature. The scene should show a blue-skinned, four-armed Vedalken wearing casual frat house attire, lounging confidently in a plush chair at the center of a lively, college party atmosphere. The decor includes banners, cups, and other fun, social elements, with other students in the background enjoying the gathering. The character exudes charisma and leadership among his peers. The style should be clear and straightforward, matching a regular Magic: The Gathering card illustration.
