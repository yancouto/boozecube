Create an illustration for a Magic: The Gathering card called "Initiation Rites," depicting a lighthearted, college party scene: a group of diverse young adults in casual fraternity apparel raise plastic cups in a playful, ceremonial toast, some wearing party hats or goofy costumes; in the background, a banner reads “Initiation Night” and party decorations hang from the ceiling, conveying a playful and sociable atmosphere.
