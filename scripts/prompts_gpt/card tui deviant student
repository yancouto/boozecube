Create detailed Magic: The Gathering card art of Tui, Deviant Student: a young, rebellious human student in a stylized magical academy setting, wearing a slightly disheveled uniform with a white and red color scheme. She sits at a desk littered with textbooks and empty drinks, a playful, mischievous grin on her face, while magical energy subtly crackles around her hand hinting at untapped potential. The environment is lively and slightly chaotic, reflecting her wild nature and potential for transformation.

For the transformed side, depict Tui, Drunken Master: she now stands confidently as a legendary human fighter, radiating supernatural indestructibility and power. Her attire is messier, with spell energy swirling around her fists, and a faint glow marks each training counter on her arms. She holds a drink aloft triumphantly in a rowdy tavern or magical duel arena, exuding both strength and a wild, party-loving spirit. The art should transition seamlessly in mood from mischievous student to unstoppable, exuberant master, using bright reds and whites throughout.
