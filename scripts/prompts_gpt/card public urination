Create an illustration for a Magic: The Gathering card titled "Public Urination," depicting a humorous, light-hearted scene of a mischievous human figure discreetly relieving themselves against a stone wall in a medieval fantasy town alley at night, with glowing yellow magical effects subtly indicating increased vitality; the mood is playful and irreverent, with the setting and character styled in classic Magic: The Gathering realism, avoiding explicit content and focusing on suggestion and comedic tone.
