A whimsical, ethereal green faerie with delicate, translucent wings hovers above a lush, verdant forest clearing at twilight, surrounded by swirling motes of magical light and faint, sparkling mist; she holds a tiny, ornate absinthe spoon, with a faint green glow illuminating her; the atmosphere is playful and enchanted, with hints of vintage absinthe poster art style, all in a palette of deep greens and shimmering golds.
