Describe a simple illustration for a Magic The Gathering card named "Tarmodrink," a Legendary Beast. Show a whimsical, sturdy beast with mossy green fur resembling Tarmogoyf, but with beverage containers (like cups, mugs, and bottles) tangled in its fur and balanced on its back. The creature should appear both powerful and quirky, standing in a tavern setting with spilled drinks around. Styling is minimal and straightforward, focusing on the humorous blend of beast and beverage theme.
