A small elf stands among natural wooden shelves formed from intertwining tree branches, each shelf covered in vibrant green moss and sprouting delicate ferns. The elf, in simple green clothes, blends seamlessly with the forest surroundings, their hands reaching out to tend to a tiny glowing sapling. Sunlight filters softly through the leafy canopy above, casting dappled light and shadow across the tranquil woodland scene.
