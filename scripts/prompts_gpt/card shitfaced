A humorous Magic The Gathering card titled "Shitfaced": art depicts a rowdy tavern scene with tipsy patrons of various fantasy races—elves, goblins, and humans—stumbling, laughing, and raising mugs overflowing with ale; bottles and magical brews litter wooden tables, and some characters look barely able to stand, in a lively, irreverent, cartoonish style fitting a silly enchantment.
