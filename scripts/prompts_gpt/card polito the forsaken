Create a Magic the Gathering card illustration for "Polito, the Forsaken," a legendary creature who is a Fratboy Assassin. Show a stylish, youthful man in casual party attire, perhaps holding a red solo cup, standing in the midst of a college party scene that feels slightly dark or ominous. His demeanor is haunted and regretful, contrasting the lively backdrop. Subtle details hint at his assassin sideâ€”maybe a hidden dagger or a shadowy aura around his hand. The mood should balance typical frat party chaos with a sense of danger and isolation, emphasizing his forsaken status. No flashy magic effects, just the contrast between his cool persona and the underlying darkness.
