Create a simple Magic: The Gathering card illustration showing a whimsical, slightly worn jack-in-the-box artifact sitting on a wooden table; the box is metallic and covered in colorful, mismatched stickers, with a handle on the side and a die balanced on top. The jack, a clown with a wide grin, is springing out, holding a mug of beer in one hand and colored mana symbols floating playfully around it. The background is a dimly lit tavern scene, casual and playful in tone.
