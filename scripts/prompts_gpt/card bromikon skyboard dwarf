Create the art for a Magic: The Gathering card featuring Bromikon, Skyboard Dwarf, a legendary Fratboy Pirate Dwarf with a stocky build and wild, windswept hair. He soars on a makeshift flying surfboard crafted from ship planks and barrels, high in a cloudy sky, a tankard of frothy ale raised jubilantly in one hand. His clothing is a ragged mix of pirate gear and casual frat party attire, with mismatched boots and loose, colorful scarves. His expression is playful and tipsy, cheeks flushed with intoxication, eyes full of reckless joy. The backdrop should show dramatic, windswept clouds and hints of distant airships. The scene conveys a sense of bold, airborne mischief.
