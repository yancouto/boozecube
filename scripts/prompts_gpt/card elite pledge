Create an image of a Magic: The Gathering card named "Elite Pledge," depicting a single, determined humanoid figure standing upright, dressed in a simple but distinguished uniform, holding a small banner or insignia. The background should be minimal, with muted tones to keep the focus on the figure’s solemn pledge. The style should be straightforward and uncluttered, reflecting the card’s basic and earnest nature.
