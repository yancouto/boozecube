Create a Magic The Gathering card art for "Frat Splicer," a creature that is a fratboy with artifact and bottle motifs; depict a college-aged man in casual party clothes, surrounded by clinking bottles, perhaps mid-chug with friends; the scene should have a lively, humorous atmosphere, emphasizing bottles as magical artifacts; simple, cartoonish style to match the playful concept.
