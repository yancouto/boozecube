Create an image for a Magic: The Gathering double-faced card. The front side, "Salt," should feature a minimalistic scene: a clean, white salt shaker spilling sparkling grains of salt over an abstract game table, conveying a sense of playful mischief and shared camaraderie. The reverse side, "Lime," should shift to a more organic and lively style: a vibrant, glowing lime sliced open with a lush landscape in its interior, from which small, cartoonish green worms emerge and crawl playfully among grassy hills, evoking energy and growthâ€”art in a classic, painterly style reminiscent of old Magic cards.
