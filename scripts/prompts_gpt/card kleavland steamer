A homarid (lobster-like humanoid) bartender stands behind a makeshift bar made of driftwood and seaweed, holding a large, foamy mug aloft. The setting is a whimsical, underwater tavern, with glowing shells and marine life as patrons. The bartender looks alert and ready to serve, as if just appearing suddenly. The art is detailed and slightly humorous, with a magical, aquatic atmosphere.
