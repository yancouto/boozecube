A bleak, desolate graveyard under a stormy sky, broken tombstones jutting from the dark earth, eerie blue spirits drifting among the graves, faint red runes glowing on the ground to represent redemption counters, a faint spectral hand reaching up from a grave, the mood is haunting and somber, in the style of classic Magic the Gathering enchantment cards.
