A fallen angel with disheveled wings lounges at a cluttered tavern bar, holding a mug overflowing with frothy beer, surrounded by empty shot glasses and spilled drinks; other patrons cheer and raise their glasses in the background, while ethereal, spectral hands emerge around the angel, hinting at supernatural power; the mood is rowdy yet mystical, with dim, warm lighting.
