Create an image of a Magic: The Gathering card called "Phyrexian Pony." The artwork features a haunting, biomechanical pony with patches of metallic armor fused with torn, decaying flesh. It stands in a misty, gloomy landscape littered with twisted, organic machinery. Its eyes glow an unnatural green, and black ichor drips from its mouth. The pony's silhouette is disturbing, blending familiar equine shapes with warped, alien Phyrexian motifs, embodying both horror and corrupted innocence. Style should be realistic and dark, emphasizing the creatureâ€™s threatening presence.
