A simple, comical artifact scene showing an exaggerated, over-the-top cartoon trap made from ropes, buckets, and springs, ready to spring in a playful tavern setting, with a few spilled beers and empty shot glasses scattered around; the art is lighthearted and fun, with a whimsical tone and no intricate detail.
