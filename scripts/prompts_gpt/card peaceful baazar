A serene and bustling bazaar set in a sunlit, open marketplace, with peaceful merchants and travelers from many lands exchanging goods; no signs of conflict or aggression, people and animals move calmly among colorful tents and stalls; magical faint wisps of light or gentle glowing sigils hover over certain travelers, evoking the idea of ‘redemption counters’—artwork is tranquil and imbued with a warm, harmonious atmosphere, fitting for a nonviolent enchantment.
