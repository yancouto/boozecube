Tezzeret, a blue-skinned, cybernetic planeswalker, sits in a futuristic lounge surrounded by glowing artifacts. He holds an ornate glass bong fashioned from metal and crystal, with intricate gears and tubing, while an avocado and a snorkel rest on a table beside him. An icepick is embedded in a block of ice near his feet, with faint magical energy crackling along its edge. The scene is stylish and playful but maintains an aura of arcane power and invention.
