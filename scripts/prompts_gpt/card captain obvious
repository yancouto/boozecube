Create a straightforward and bold Magic the Gathering card illustration featuring a confident human pirate captain standing on the deck of a ship, pointing dramatically at something clear on the horizon, dressed in standard pirate attire with minimal ornamentation; the scene is simple and direct, matching the character's obvious and matter-of-fact nature, with flat colors and clean lines, without elaborate background details.
