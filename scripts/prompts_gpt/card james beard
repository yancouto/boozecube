Create an illustration of "James Beard," a Human Pirate Rogue in Magic: The Gathering style; depict a sly, wiry pirate with a mischievous grin, wearing tattered clothes and a tricorn hat, sneaking through the shadows of a dimly lit tavern with bottles of booze in his belt, suggesting stealth and cunning; art should be simple and character-focused, with minimal background details.
