Create an image of a Magic: The Gathering card called "Usain Bolt," a Legendary Creature â€“ Human. The art should depict a swift, athletic man in mid-sprint, his muscles taut with energy, racing across a blurred urban nightscape. He looks exhilarated, possibly slightly unsteady as if a little intoxicated, with flashy running apparel and streaks of movement or afterimages behind him to emphasize incredible speed. The overall tone is dynamic and lively, focused on motion and intensity, with no fantasy elements beyond the hyper-real sense of speed.
