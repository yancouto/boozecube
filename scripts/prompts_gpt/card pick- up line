Create an illustration for a Magic: The Gathering card called "Pick-Up Line," a common sorcery. Depict a humorous and casual tavern scene: two fantasy characters, one holding up a random card from their hand, both laughing, with mugs on the table. The atmosphere is playful and lighthearted, hinting at the innuendo of the flavor text, but keeping the tone fun. The background features other patrons and subtle magical elements. The style should be simple and clean, matching the cardâ€™s common rarity.
