Create simple, playful Magic: The Gathering card art for "Drunkiate," a sorcery. Show a whimsical tavern scene with several fantasy characters seated around a large table, some trying to focus while others laugh with mugs raised. Above them, floating magical illusions show the words "clarity" and "confusion." The style should be lighthearted and colorful, emphasizing the humor and chaos of the voting dilemma.
