Create a Magic: The Gathering card illustration for “Racist Slime,” depicting a menacing, amorphous ooze creature with shifting, multicolored tendrils, exuding a toxic aura that warps and distorts the figures of various nearby fantasy creatures, subtly draining their forms; the scene is unsettling yet fantastical, with muted colors and dark, brooding atmosphere, in a stylized, somewhat abstract art style fitting for a sinister and unnatural Ooze.
