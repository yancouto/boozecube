Create an image of a Magic: The Gathering card called "Brethalyzer," an Artifact. The art shows a whimsical, fantasy-inspired breathalyzer device made of enchanted brass and glass, glowing softly with magical runes. The device sits atop a wooden tavern counter, surrounded by spilled mugs and faint magical mist. In the background, revelers blur in motion, emphasizing the connection to drinking. The mood is lighthearted yet mystical, fitting the theme of a magical tavern gadget. No elaborate styling, just simple, clear, and direct illustration.
