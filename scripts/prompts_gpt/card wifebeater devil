A small, vicious devil with red skin, horns, and a mischievous grin stands in the foreground, wielding a spiked club. It is surrounded by a faint, sinister aura, and the background is a dim, infernal tavern filled with broken tables and spilled drinks, evoking chaos and danger. The style is gritty and dark, with sharp shadows and lively expressions, fitting a typical Rakdos devil creature in Magic: The Gathering.
