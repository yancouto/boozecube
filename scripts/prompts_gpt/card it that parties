Create an illustration for a Magic: The Gathering card called "It That Parties," depicting a bizarre Eldrazi Drone with a fratboy twistâ€”an otherworldly, tentacled creature wearing a backwards cap, holding a red solo cup, and standing amidst a chaotic college party scene; alien architecture blends with beer kegs, streamers, and pizza boxes. The mood is wild, humorous, and slightly surreal, matching the absurd party theme.
