Create an image of a humble, unassuming necromancer—a human shaman wizard, in simple dark robes, standing in a barren graveyard at twilight. He holds a cracked, glowing staff, and faint, ghostly hands claw their way out of the earth around him, momentarily animated. His expression is uncertain, unsure of his power. The mood is somber, a little comical, not grandiose—emphasize his mediocrity but show fleeting traces of forbidden magic at work.
