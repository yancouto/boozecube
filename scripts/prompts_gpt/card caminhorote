A massive, whimsical vehicle shaped like a battered wagon overflowing with bottles, barrels, and kegs, its wheels uneven and jugs hanging from every corner, lurches forward down a raucous cobblestone road; raucous partygoers with flushed cheeks and wild grins stagger alongside, some climbing aboard, cups raised mid-toast, while errant bottles seem to animate themselves, trailing after the wagon, all depicted in a lively, comic style, with bold lines and playful color.
