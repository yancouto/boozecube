A stylized Magic: The Gathering planeswalker card illustration for "Miojo, the Unfortunate"â€”depict a somber, unlucky figure cloaked in threadbare robes, sitting alone at a worn wooden table beneath a flickering lamp, a half-eaten bowl of instant noodles before them; expression weary, eyes haunted by fate, hands hovering indecisively over the food; the background is a sparse, shadow-filled room, with subtle mystical symbols scrawled on the walls hinting at arcane power, blending subdued colors and moody lighting to evoke both humor and tragedy.
