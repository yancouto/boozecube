Create an image of a Magic: The Gathering card titled "Pina Coladaburg." The art depicts a tropical island transformed into a festive, whimsical paradise: palm trees topped with pineapple and coconut decorations, colorful drinks with little umbrellas scattered along a radiant blue shoreline, and a single sandy beach hut with a sign reading "Drinks Here!" The overall mood is lighthearted and fun, suggesting a magical oasis where one can relax and enjoy a pina colada. Style is simple and playful, appropriate for a humorous Aura enchantment.
