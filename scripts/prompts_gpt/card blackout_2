Create Magic: The Gathering card art for "Blackout_2," a sorcery card with a chaotic, punishing theme. Depict a dark, ethereal wave sweeping over a group of players at a table, their figures flickering and dissolving into shadow. Cards, life counters, creatures, and half-empty beverages all swirl in the dark maelstrom, symbolizing loss and forced sacrifice. The lighting is moody and foreboding, with magical, shadowy energy fracturing reality, emphasizing the disruptive power of the spell.
