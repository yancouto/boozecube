Create a Magic: The Gathering card illustration for "Two Girls," a Horror creature. The art should be eerie and unsettling, featuring two young girls standing side by side in a dimly lit, shadowy environment. Their faces are partly obscured in darkness, and their forms are subtly distorted to evoke a supernatural feeling. Between them, they hold a single, ordinary cup in their hands, which appears out of place and carries an ominous presence. The atmosphere is cold and foreboding, with faint swirling mist at their feet, hinting at horror and discomfort. No elaborate background, focus on the two girls and the cup.
