Create the art for a Magic: The Gathering card called "A Two at Ten // A Ten at Two." On the "A Two at Ten" side, depict a lively, crowded bar late at night with dim lighting, as a scruffy patron tries to corral their tipsy friend toward the exit; the scene is humorous and chaotic, with empty glasses and spilled drinks on the table. For the "A Ten at Two" side, portray an elegant glow-up: the same bar now illuminated by sunrise through the windows, with the formerly scruffy patron looking refreshed and triumphant, raising a glass in a toast, surrounded by more sophisticated drinks like tequila shots and cocktails. The overall style is playful and lighthearted, reminiscent of vintage bar illustrations.
