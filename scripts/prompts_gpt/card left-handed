A whimsical Magic: The Gathering card illustration for "Left-Handed," featuring a magical, oversized left hand glowing with mystical energy, hovering over a chaotic tabletop where permanents are being tapped incorrectly, with comical puffs of smoke and zaps indicating players getting mildly zapped or surprised, in a simple, playful art style.
