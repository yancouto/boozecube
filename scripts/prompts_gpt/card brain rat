Create simple, modern fantasy art for a Magic: The Gathering card named "Brain Rat": depict a sinister, oversized rat with a slightly exaggerated head, glowing red eyes, and an eerie, almost intelligent expression. The rat lurks in a shadowy, undefined environment, giving a sense of lurking menace and psychological danger. Use a limited, muted color palette to enhance the creepy, mysterious vibe and keep the overall style clean and straightforward rather than highly detailed.
