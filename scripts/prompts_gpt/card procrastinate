Draw a Magic The Gathering card called "Procrastinate," an instant. The art shows a wizard lounging in a messy study, surrounded by scattered scrolls, glowing magical clocks, and floating hourglasses ticking down. One spell hovers midair, frozen mid-cast, while the wizard looks bored and distracted, staring off into space instead of focusing. The mood is whimsical and light, with lots of magical time elements and a sense of delay or waiting, fitting the idea of putting something off until later.
