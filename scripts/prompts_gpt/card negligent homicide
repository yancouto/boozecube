A darkly humorous Magic: The Gathering card titled "Negligent Homicide," depicting a surprised wizard accidentally blasting a creature with a chaotic spell, while bystanders look shocked and annoyed; the scene is lighthearted despite the spell's destructive effect, with exaggerated expressions reflecting annoyance more than horror, in a simple, cartoonish art style fitting the card's irreverent tone.
