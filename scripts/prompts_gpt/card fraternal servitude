Create an image of a Magic: The Gathering card named "Fraternal Servitude." The artwork should depict two players at a table, one serving a drink to the other in a friendly, but slightly begrudging manner. The background should subtly suggest a magical enchantment, such as faint glowing runes or ethereal chains gently connecting them. The setting is casual, reflecting the social and lighthearted nature of the card's abilities. The scene should represent camaraderie tinged with obligation, without elaborate detail, focusing on clear, expressive body language.
