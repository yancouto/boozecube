Create an image of a Magic: The Gathering card titled "Get Over Here." The art shows two opponents, each with a drink in hand, standing on opposite sides of a tavern table. One player is magically pulling the other’s creature—an orc—across the table by a glowing lasso of energy, while their own hulking ogre prepares to brawl. The scene is lively and dramatic, with spilled drinks and shocked onlookers in the background, in a straightforward, dynamic fantasy style.
