Draw a Magic: The Gathering card called "Shits // Desist." On the "Shits" half, illustrate a mischievous creature, perhaps an imp or goblin, tossing a glowing magical +1/+1 counter onto a surprised creature who is bulking up and gaining an aura of wild energy (trample and "boozetouch") with comical glowing sparkles surrounding them. On the "Desist" half, show a serious magical confrontation: a sorcerer or wizard raises a hand while drinking from a mystical bottle, the drink's energy visibly flowing from them to remove glowing counters from an ominous artifact or corrupted creature, in an old-school, slightly rough and playful art style reminiscent of 1990s MTG artworks.
