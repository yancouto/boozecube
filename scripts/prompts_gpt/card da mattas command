A Magic The Gathering card illustration featuring a dynamic, horizontal scene blending blue and black tones: A commanding, mysterious figure stands at the center, raising a glass in one hand and gesturing authoritatively with the other, as swirling magical energy and shadowy wisps emanate from them. Around the figure, a suspended sense of tension among several adversaries—some holding drinks halfway to their lips, others hesitating or resisting magical force. The environment is otherworldly, with flowing water and dark mist mingling, creating an atmosphere that is both alluring and perilous—a visual balance of intellect (blue) and manipulation (black), in a style that is detailed yet clear, emphasizing the figure’s power to impose rules on drinking and magic alike.
