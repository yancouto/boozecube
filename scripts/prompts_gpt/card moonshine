Create the art for a Magic: The Gathering card called "Moonshine," a massive and wild Elemental creature. Depict a hulking, chaotic being made of swirling moonlit mist, barrels, and wild overgrown vines, with a fierce, mischievous face. It towers over the landscape, its limbs splashing with glowing liquid and shards of wood, evoking the feel of a magical, drunken rampage. The creature’s posture shows both its immense power and unruly, joyous energy. In the background, under a bright full moon, creatures cheer and raise mugs as they follow its path. The mood is rowdy and untamed, matching the quote, “Lemme hear you squeal like a tusker!” — style bold, energetic, and a bit whimsical.
