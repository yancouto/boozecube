A single robed figure stands at a shadowy gambling table, in a dark, candle-lit room. Etched black coins and glowing mana orbs are stacked before them as spectral cards drift in midair. The figure’s hand hovers over piles of black mana, while a swirling vortex of life energy rises and falls around them, representing risk and reward. The atmosphere is tense and mysterious, with deep shadows and a subtle violet-black glow illuminating the scene, evoking a sense of dangerous strategy in line with black mana’s themes.
