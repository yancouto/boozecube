Create an illustration for a Magic: The Gathering card named "Lil’ Nabber," a small, mischievous crab creature scuttling on a sandy beach, one claw outstretched as if snatching a tiny bottle from an unsuspecting traveler; the crab’s eyes are bright with cunning, and its shell glistens with hints of playful, magical energy; the overall style is simple and whimsical, with bold outlines and minimal background detail to match the card’s lighthearted and tricky nature.
