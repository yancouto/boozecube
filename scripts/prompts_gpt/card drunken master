Create an illustration for a Magic: The Gathering card featuring a "Drunken Master" — depict a wiry human monk in loose robes, swaying mid-strike with a serene yet tipsy expression, holding a traditional clay jug, standing on one foot with dynamic, flowing movement, set in a sparsely decorated dojo at dusk — the art should have a straightforward, classic fantasy style with a touch of humor reflecting the drunken martial arts theme.
