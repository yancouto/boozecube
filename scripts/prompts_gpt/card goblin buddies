Create an illustration for a Magic: The Gathering sorcery card called "Goblin Buddies." The art features a group of mischievous, red-skinned goblins gathered around a table. Half of the goblins are happily sharing cards, laughing and exchanging hands, while the others look disgruntled and are reluctantly sipping from oversized tankards. The scene is playful and humorous, with vibrant colors, exaggerated goblin expressions, and a lively tavern background full of goblin antics.
