Create Magic: The Gathering card art for a double-faced card. Front side ("Wake")—a gentle sunrise illuminates a tranquil bedroom, a figure slowly rising from bed, soft morning light streaming through the window, books and coffee on a bedside table, peaceful and minimalistic scene. Reverse side ("Bake")—dynamic illustration of the same figure in a chaotic kitchen, pouring coffee grounds into a mug, a bubbling cauldron of black liquid, swirling dark magic and energy, cartoonish and playful style, echoing classic 1990s Magic art.
