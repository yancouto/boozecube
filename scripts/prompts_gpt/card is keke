Create an illustration for a Magic The Gathering card titled "... Is Keke." Show a simple, magical transformation scene where a nondescript object or creature is enveloped by a whimsical blue aura, losing all its original features and becoming a small, playful blue spirit-like being named "Keke," with a minimalist design and clear 1/1 presence. The background is plain or subtly magical, reflecting the enchantmentâ€™s impact.
