Create Magic the Gathering card art for "Liquor in the Front // Poker in the Rear." For "Liquor in the Front," depict a lively Old West saloon interior: bottles and glasses behind the bar, patrons cheering and laughing, vibrant lighting, and a sense of raucous festivity. For "Poker in the Rear," transition to a shadowy back room where cowboys sit around a poker table, smoky air, focused expressions, piles of cards and coins, and one player discreetly discarding a card. Art style is reminiscent of classic Western illustrations, with lively brushwork and rich, earthy tones.
