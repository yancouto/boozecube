A burly Minotaur staggers through a shattered tavern, ale sloshing from a barrel clutched under one arm, his eyes wild and defiant. Broken mugs and splintered tables litter the floor, while a few cowering patrons peek from behind wreckage. His fur is matted from spilled drink, and he stands in a pose both imposing and off-balance, suggesting both strength and intoxication. The lighting is warm and chaotic, with a sense of raucous disorder. Style is detailed, evoking the rowdy aftermath of a fantasy brawl.
