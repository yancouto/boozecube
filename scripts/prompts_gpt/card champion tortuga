A colorful, comical bird pirate with a wooden peg leg stands confidently on the deck of a pirate ship, surrounded by a ragtag crew of pirate birds. The bird wears a tattered pirate hat, an eye patch, and a sash with gold coins. Bright blue ocean and distant islands provide the backdrop. The mood is playful and irreverent, matching the card’s humorous flavor: “Polly wants to pillage.” The bird is noticeably grounded—definitely not flying.
