A charismatic, larger-than-life pirate captain stands at the helm of a grand blue pirate ship, bottle of rum aloft in one hand, casting a magical aura over the churning sea; the ship is festooned with nautical symbols, its sails billowing under a moonlit sky, with glimmering water and distant islands; the captainâ€™s coat is richly detailed, evoking a sense of revelry, adventure, and command, in a bold, dynamic illustration that balances whimsy and authority.
