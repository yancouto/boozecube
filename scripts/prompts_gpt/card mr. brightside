Create a Magic: The Gathering card art for "Mr. Brightside," a legendary saint. Show a radiant, ethereal figure in flowing white robes, bathed in golden sunlight, hands outstretched benevolently. His expression is serene yet subtly sorrowful, hinting at inner turmoil. In the background, ghostly silhouettes evoke a sense of lost control. The scene is realistic but with a slightly dreamlike glow, fitting a 5/5 lifelink creature whose fate is to return under an opponentâ€™s control.
