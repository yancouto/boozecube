Create the art for a Magic The Gathering card called "Rolê Andarilho": depict a whimsical scene of a magical enchantment swirling around and whisking away an opponent’s prized possession (such as a glowing artifact or creature), with playful, ethereal energy. The background shows a casual party atmosphere, with people holding drinks and laughing, evoking a fun, lighthearted mood. Use simple, clean lines and minimalistic styling to give it an unembellished but enchanting appearance, with a focus on the playful interaction between magic and the casual party setting.
