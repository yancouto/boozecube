A medieval fantasy scene showing a proud knight or royal figure being publicly shamed in a vibrant court, wearing a dunce-like hat or placard, surrounded by laughing courtiers and stern nobles, while a ghostly, magical aura binds them, illustrating their inability to act; the mood is both regal and humiliating, with rich colors and classic Magic the Gathering enchantment flair.
