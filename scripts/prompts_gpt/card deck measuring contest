A whimsical Magic: The Gathering scene showing several planeswalkers at a long wooden table, each proudly placing their library (deck of cards) upright on the table, rulers and measuring tapes in hand, laughing and competing to see whose deck is tallest; background filled with magical sparkles and stacks of cards, capturing a lighthearted, playful contest atmosphere.
