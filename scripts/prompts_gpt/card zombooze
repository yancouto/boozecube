Create a Magic: The Gathering card art for "Zombooze," a zombie creature with a simple, non-stylized design. Depict a staggering, undead zombie holding a bottle or mug, looking disheveled yet menacing, with glowing eyes and ragged clothing. The background should suggest a dimly lit tavern or bar, with other shadowy figures or empty bottles scattered around. The atmosphere should be dark, slightly humorous, and eerie, matching the cardâ€™s mischievous and dangerous flavor.
