Create an image of a Magic: The Gathering card named "Robopirate," an Artifact Creature â€” Construct Pirate. The art shows a mechanical pirate made of metal and gears, with a glowing blue eye and a robotic hook hand, standing on a futuristic ship deck under a cloudy sky. The pirate has a sturdy, blocky build, and small details like bolts and rivets are visible. The scene is fun and slightly whimsical, with a mug of frothy drink in one hand and the other hand raised as if toasting. The overall style is clear and straightforward, with minimal stylistic embellishments.
