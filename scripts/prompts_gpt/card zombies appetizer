Create an image of a Magic The Gathering card titled "Zombieâ€™s Appetizer": show a spooky, dimly-lit graveyard at night, with ragged zombies hunched over a makeshift table filled with steaming, mysterious drinks. The zombies are eagerly reaching for the glasses, shadows and fog curling around them. The atmosphere should feel eerie and dark, with a sense of grim humor. The art should be straightforward and not overly detailed, reflecting the card's simple styling.
