Create an image of an artifact creature construct named "Edward Fortyhands," depicted as a humanoid figure made from metal and wires, with two large 40oz bottles attached as hands. The scene is straightforward and somewhat humorous, showing the construct standing upright, slightly awkwardly, with the bottles prominently featured. The background is simple and does not distract from the figure, evoking a lighthearted, casual atmosphere fitting the card's playful theme.
