Create artwork for a Magic: The Gathering card called "Trivial Pursuit." Depict a simple scene of two friends at a table playing Trivial Pursuit, with a colorful game board, question cards, and a single die. One friend looks thoughtful, ready to answer, while the other smiles playfully, holding a card. The setting is cozy and casual, resembling a relaxed game night. The overall style should be clean and straightforward, without ornate details.
