Create an image of a Magic: The Gathering card called "Timber Shiverer," depicting a zombie pirate rising from the misty grave of an abandoned shipwreck, tattered pirate coat hanging from its skeletal frame, glowing eerie blue eyes, and a cutlass in one bony hand. The background shows ghostly pirate silhouettes emerging from the foggy shoreline, with spectral ships barely visible behind them. The atmosphere is moody and ominous, evoking themes of undead piracy and forgotten legends.
