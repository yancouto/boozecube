A simple, humorous Magic: The Gathering card illustration of an artifact shaped like an ordinary metal ice cream scoop, sitting on a plain tabletop with two frothy beer mugs and a couple of shot glasses nearby; the overall composition is minimalist to match the joke-y, casual theme, with a playful, irreverent atmosphere.
