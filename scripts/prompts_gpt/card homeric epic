Illustrate a simple Magic: The Gathering card called "Homeric Epic"—an Aura enchantment. Show an ancient scroll unfurled across a table, its parchment inscribed with epic poetry, as soft golden light bathes the scene. A faint spectral outline of a heroic figure emerges from the scroll’s text, representing the creature being enchanted. The atmosphere is scholarly, evoking the timeless legacy of myths, without elaborate details or dramatic action.
