A whimsical Magic: The Gathering card art scene showing a mystical pizza parlor built into a lush enchanted forest; the restaurant sign glows “Argoth Pizza” among gigantic, magical trees, forest fairies and druids sitting at wooden tables enjoying pizza and magical drinks, with fantastical glowing mushrooms and vines wrapping around the building—warm, inviting, and humorous, with hints of mana energy lighting up the scene.
