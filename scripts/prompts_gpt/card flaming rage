A wild, chaotic tavern scene bursting with magical energy; flames swirl around angry, intoxicated patrons as tankards clash and drinks are spilled, faces flushed with rage; the background glows red-orange with crackling fire magic, highlighting a central figure casting a spell with one hand while holding a drink in the otherâ€”dynamic, energetic, and full of fiery, drunken chaos suitable for a Conspiracy-type Magic: The Gathering card.
