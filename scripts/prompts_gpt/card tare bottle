Create stylized Magic: The Gathering card art for "Tare Bottle," a horizontal green artifact token creature. The art shows a quirky, animated glass bottle standing upright, filled with a swirling, vibrant green liquid that glows softly. The bottle has subtle, playful features, like small cartoon eyes and a mischievous grin, and it's capped with a cork. Sparkling droplets float around it, hinting at its magical nature. The background is simple but energetic, with blurred bokeh lights suggesting a lively tavern atmosphere. Make the overall mood whimsical and lighthearted, fitting the artifact's Boozetouch ability.
