Create simple, playful Magic: The Gathering card art for "The Thumbmaster": depict a group of people sitting around a wooden table, all focused on a humorous thumb game—several thumbs press dramatically against the table’s edge. The setting is lighthearted, with friends laughing, drinks in hand, and a whimsical, casual atmosphere. The art should be clear and straightforward, with emphasis on the thumbs and the group interaction, using bright, inviting colors.
