Create an image of a Magic: The Gathering card called "Binge and Purge." Show a lively party scene with revelers drinking from mugs and bottles, with one figure magically pulling a glowing card or artifact out of a ghostly grave. The mood is chaotic and celebratory, conveying both the excess and the supernatural element of returning something from the dead. The style is straightforward and bold, with simple but expressive figures and a focus on the magical act in the center.
