Magic: The Gathering card "Cease // Desist" â€” For "Cease": portray a sleek and minimal magical barrier forming between two dueling wizards, with swirling blue energy halting an oncoming spell, in a modern digital art style to match a blue instant. For "Desist": illustrate a vintage, old-school Magic vibe with a mage extinguishing a spell mid-cast, holding up a hand in a gesture of refusal, surrounded by goblets and tankards, subtle hints of revelry in the background, using painterly textures.
