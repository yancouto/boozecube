Create an image of a simple wooden beer pong table set up for a game, with ten red plastic cups arranged in a triangle at each end, some cups partially filled and condensation visible. The setting is casual, perhaps in a college dorm room or backyard at dusk, with scattered ping pong balls and beverage cans nearby. The artwork should evoke a playful, lighthearted atmosphere, focusing on the table and cups as the central elements.
