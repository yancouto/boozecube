Create an image of a Magic: The Gathering card titled "Amanda, Enemy of the End," depicting a legendary Human Druidâ€”a determined young woman with a wild, untamed look, wearing green and brown robes interwoven with vines and leaves. She stands in a mystical forest clearing, holding a wooden staff adorned with age markings, with faint spectral age counters glowing around her. Her eyes flicker with resilience and the magic of nature. The background grows progressively darker and more fantastical as the age counters increase, suggesting her transformation and growing power. The mood is one of raw vitality, growth, and the unstoppable advance of time, fitting a card that becomes stronger and gains magical abilities as it ages. Style should be detailed and grounded in realistic fantasy art.
