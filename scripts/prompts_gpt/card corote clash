Create an image of a Magic: The Gathering card called "Corote Clash." The art should be simple and lively, depicting two friends sitting at a rustic table, each flipping a coin in the air while laughing. In the background, bottles and glasses hint at a casual drinking game. The mood is playful and light-hearted, with a touch of mischief, matching the chaotic and fun nature of the spell.
