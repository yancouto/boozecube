A humorous Magic: The Gathering sorcery card titled "Eric, Drinker Of Worlds." Depict a jovial, slightly disheveled man surrounded by magical energy, holding a goblet, with bewildered onlookers raising drinks around him. The background is full of mystical, festive chaos and scattered empty glasses. The tone is light-hearted and tongue-in-cheek, matching the irreverent flavor text. Style is simple and comical, avoiding excessive detail, with emphasis on the absurd situation.
