Create a simple Magic: The Gathering card art for "Big Blind," an enchantment aura. Depict a ghostly poker table with several shadowy, indistinct players seated around it, each passing a glowing, magical poker chip to the next. The scene is minimalist with muted colors, focusing on the act of passing the chip and the mysterious, shifting energy around the table. The background is dark and abstract, emphasizing the enchantmentâ€™s uncanny and cyclical nature.
