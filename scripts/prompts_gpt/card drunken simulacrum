Create the art for a Magic the Gathering card called "Drunken Simulacrum," depicting a whimsical, metallic construct shaped like a humanoid made of mismatched, worn brass and copper parts, stumbling unsteadily as if intoxicated; its glowing eyes are unfocused and one arm outstretches, loosely clutching a tipped-over goblet with liquid trailing behind. The background shows a tavern with wooden beams and barrels, blurred to emphasize the construct's drunken gait. The tone is playful but simple, with minimal stylization.
