Create a Magic The Gathering card illustration for "Shepherd of Neglect", an Elder Human creature. The scene shows an aged, disheveled human in tattered robes standing amidst a barren, wind-swept field. Their posture is listless, holding a crooked staff loosely at their side, eyes unfocused, exuding an aura of apathetic detachment. Around them, empty cups and broken bottles litter the ground, emphasizing neglect and resignation. The mood is somber and indifferent, with muted, earthy tones, minimalist background, and little movement or energy in the art.
