Create an image of a Magic The Gathering card creature called "Superstar Cop": a Human Cop with slick sunglasses, wielding a guitar slung over one shoulder and sporting a police badge, flying above city rooftops at night. Their pose is dynamic and heroic, with a trail of musical notes in the air, suggesting both flight and rock-and-roll energy. The overall vibe is energetic and rebellious, fitting a cop who is also a cool rockstar. The city skyline glows beneath them, and there's a sense of stylish swagger and attitude.
