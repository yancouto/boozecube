Create an image of Nath of the Weed-Leaf, a Legendary Elf Stoner: depict a relaxed, scruffy elf lounging in a lush forest, surrounded by oversized weed leaves and faint traces of smoke curling around him; his eyes are half-lidded, and he's grinning mischievously, holding a leafy joint; some elvish warriors with similar chilled expressions gather nearby amidst a hazy, green-lit woodland atmosphere; make the tone playful and irreverent, with rich green hues and a slightly cartoonish, humorous style.
