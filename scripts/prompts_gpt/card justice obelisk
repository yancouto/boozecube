A towering ancient obelisk of stone and steel rises in a stark, barren landscape. Magical runes in the shapes of liquid droplets and white light glow along its sides, casting an austere, impartial radiance over the land. The atmosphere is solemn and orderly, reflecting the artifact's strict enforcement of magical balance. No characters are presentâ€”focus is on the monumental obelisk and its imposing, minimalist power.
