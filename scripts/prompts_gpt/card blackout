Create artwork for a Magic: The Gathering card named "Blackout", an enchantment, showing an eerie, dimly-lit tavern interior with shadowy figures and flickering candles casting deep shadows. A few drunken patrons play a coin flip game at a stained wooden table, their faces half-hidden in gloom. Empty mugs and beer steins clutter the scene, and ghostly silhouettes of vanished revelers suggest recent disappearances. The overall atmosphere is dark, moody, and slightly chaotic, evoking both supernatural menace and the wild unpredictability of a night gone wrong.
