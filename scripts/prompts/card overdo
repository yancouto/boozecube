Here are a few prompt options for Stable Diffusion, ranging in detail and style, based on the "Overdo" card description:

**Option 1 (Detailed & Thematic - Good for High Detail):**

"A dynamic, cinematic illustration of a frantic wizard pouring a shimmering, bubbling potion onto the battlefield, surrounded by swirling mana colors and a chaotic, beer-soaked tavern scene in the background, clearly a powerful instant spell, dramatic lighting, magical effects, intricate details, art by Greg Rutkowski"

**Option 2 (Stylized & Energetic - Good for a Vibrant Look):**

"A vibrant, cartoonish illustration of a wizard frantically casting an instant spell, scattering mana shards and a spilled beer, a chaotic and energetic depiction of 'Overdo,' bold colors, dynamic lines, fantasy art, bright and saturated"

**Option 3 (Simple & Direct - Good for a Clean Look):**

"A stylized instant card art depicting a wizard casting a spell, with mana symbols and a beer bottle spilling, clean lines, fantasy illustration, 'Overdo' card art, vibrant colors"

**Option 4 (Short & Concise - Good for Experimentation):**

"Wizard casting instant spell, mana, beer spill, 'Overdo,' fantasy art, dynamic lighting"

**Tips for Using the Prompt:**

*   **Experiment with keywords:** Add or remove terms like "epic," "detailed," "fantasy," "watercolor," "digital art," etc. to change the style.
*   **Adjust the artist:**  Try different artists (e.g., "art by Alphonse Mucha," "art by Hayao Miyazaki") to influence the style.
*   **Negative prompts:** Consider adding negative prompts like "blur," "low quality," "out of focus" to help avoid undesirable results.
