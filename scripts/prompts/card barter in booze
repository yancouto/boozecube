A dramatic, slightly stylized illustration of a dimly lit tavern scene; a swirling vortex of dark liquid and shattered glass surrounds a weathered wooden table where a cloaked figure (representing the instant) throws dice, casting a sickly green glow, with two grotesque, miniature creatures erupting in agony around the table, inspired by baroque fantasy art.
