A vibrant, slightly surreal image depicting a swirling vortex of flour and sugar, illuminated by glowing runes, with a humanoid figure (Wake) extending a hand towards the vortex, pulling cards from it â€“ three cards erupting upwards, and two more being placed onto a stylized library, all rendered in a painterly style reminiscent of classic Magic: The Gathering art, emphasizing a sense of chaotic creation and brewing magic.
