Iam sofu98cking wastged right onw. REm3nr when we laiberaed Karn? taht was fudciking awesomme..” – casting a shimmering, hazy wave that briefly summons a small, distressed goblin creature onto the battlefield. Haste effect indicated by blurred movement, intoxicated effect by a slightly swaying posture. Old-school MTG art style, vibrant colors, common card aesthetic.
