A dramatic, painterly illustration of a powerfully built, muscular dwarf beast - Leonardo of Burning Mana - wielding a massive, rune-covered hammer that erupts with fiery orange and red mana. He stands amidst a chaotic scene of swirling, burning mana pools and frustrated human opponents, some collapsing in agony with their hands outstretched, symbolizing the draining of their mana. Detailed dwarf musculature, battle-worn armor, and a sense of overwhelming destructive power. Cinematic lighting, epic fantasy art, highly detailed.
