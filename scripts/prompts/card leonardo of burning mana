Here are a few prompt options for Stable Diffusion, ranging in detail and style, based on the Leonardo of Burning Mana card description:

**Option 1 (Detailed & Powerful):**

"Epic fantasy art, Leonardo of Burning Mana, a powerfully built dwarf beast wielding a flaming staff, surrounded by swirling, chaotic mana, dwarven ruins in the background, dramatic lighting, vibrant colors, highly detailed, dynamic pose, Magic: The Gathering card art, intricate design."

**Option 2 (More Stylized & Focused on the Effect):**

"Leonardo of Burning Mana, a stout dwarf beast with fiery eyes, casting a wave of radiant energy, dwarven runes glowing around him, players around him visibly losing life and adding RG mana symbols, stylized magic effect, Magic: The Gathering card art, bold colors, strong composition."

**Option 3 (Simple & Direct):**

"Leonardo of Burning Mana, dwarf beast, raging magic, mana symbols, life loss, MTG card art, dynamic lighting, fantasy illustration."

**Key Considerations for Stable Diffusion:**

*   **"MTG Card Art"**:  This helps steer the AI towards the correct visual style.
*   **Descriptive Keywords**: Use words like “dwarf,” “beast,” “mana,” “magic,” “rune,” “life loss,” and “dynamic” to guide the AI.
*   **Art Style**:  You can add phrases like "painterly," "digital art," "concept art," or "photorealistic" to influence the overall aesthetic.

To help me refine the prompt even further, could you tell me:

*   What kind of style are you hoping for (e.g., realistic, painterly, cartoonish)?
