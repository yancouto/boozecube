A highly detailed, cinematic illustration of an ancient, weary Human Wizard, the Oracle of Dis’Qo, seated within a crumbling, moss-covered stone chamber deep beneath a volcanic peak. He’s surrounded by glowing runes and bubbling potions, casting a subtle, ethereal light. He holds a simple wooden staff, gestures with a knowing expression, and a faint mist of swirling mana emanates from his hands. Style: Dark fantasy, intricate detail, evocative lighting, old-master painting.
