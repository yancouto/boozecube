Here are a few Stable Diffusion prompts based on the Magic: The Gathering card "Lose Your Friends," ranging in style and complexity:

**Option 1 (Detailed & Dramatic):**

"A swirling, chaotic scene depicting a crumbling cityscape overlaid with a dark, viscous liquid, resembling spilled drinks. Spectral figures of people are dissolving into the liquid. A powerful, arcane sorcerer in ornate robes casts a destructive spell, with cracks appearing in the ground. Dramatic lighting, vibrant arcane colors, detailed textures, cinematic, Magic The Gathering art."

**Option 2 (Stylized & Concise):**

"Arcane sorcerer casting a destructive spell over a ruined landscape, liquid spilling from destroyed lands, people dissolving, vibrant colors, stylized magic, Magic The Gathering card art."

**Option 3 (Simple & Focused):**

"A sorcerer unleashes a wave of destructive arcane energy over a ruined land, with spectral figures dissolving.  Bright, chaotic colors, Magic The Gathering card illustration."

**Key Considerations for Stable Diffusion:**

*   **Keywords:** I’ve included common keywords used for Magic: The Gathering art (e.g., "Magic The Gathering art," "arcane," "sorcerer").
*   **Style:** You can adjust the prompt further to specify a particular art style (e.g., "oil painting," "digital art," "concept art").
*   **Details:** Add specific details about the sorcerer's appearance, clothing, or the environment to refine the image.

To help me refine the prompt further, could you tell me:

*   What kind of art style are you hoping for (e.g., realistic, painterly, cartoonish)?
*   Are there any specific colors you’d like to emphasize?
