A dramatic, slightly aged illustration of a gaunt, pale vampire named Buzzkiller, perched atop a crumbling stone table littered with shattered goblets and spilled wine. Heâ€™s mid-gesture, a sinister smile playing on his lips as he drains a ruby-red life force from an unseen victim, with streaks of blood flowing towards him.  Dark, gothic art style, volumetric lighting, cinematic, high detail, aged parchment texture.
