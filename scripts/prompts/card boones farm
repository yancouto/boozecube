A vibrant, slightly stylized illustration of a rustic farm scene at twilight. A weathered wooden farmhouse sits amidst rolling hills, bathed in the warm glow of a setting sun. In the foreground, a swirling, iridescent mist emanates from the farmhouse, subtly shifting colors – deep reds, purples, and greens – forming the shape of a stylized plus sign (+). A single, ancient apple tree stands prominently, its branches laden with glowing, crimson apples. The art style leans towards painterly fantasy, reminiscent of classic Magic The Gathering land illustrations, with a focus on warm colors and a sense of mystical energy.
