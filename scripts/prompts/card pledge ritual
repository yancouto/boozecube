A dynamic and slightly chaotic illustration for a Magic: The Gathering card titled "Pledge Ritual," depicting a dimly lit fraternity house command zone overflowing with laughing, inebriated college students - the "Pledges" - drinking from overflowing beer mugs. Several of the pledges are transformed into 2/2 white "Fratboys" tokens, with +1/+1 counters on them.  Focus on a stylized, m15-conspiracy aesthetic, with bright, saturated colors and a slightly exaggerated, almost cartoonish feel.  Include subtle magical effects around the beer mugs.
