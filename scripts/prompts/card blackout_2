Here are a few Stable Diffusion prompts based on the Blackout_2 card description, varying in style and detail:

**Option 1 (Detailed & Dramatic):**

"A swirling, chaotic black vortex engulfing a table laden with shattered game beverage bottles and discarded cards, a lone, terrified player screaming in the foreground, dramatic lighting, dark fantasy, Magic The Gathering art, intricate details, high resolution."

**Option 2 (Stylized & Evocative):**

"Abstract art depicting a shattered hourglass spilling dark energy over a miniature game table, blurred figures in the background, sharp color contrasts, Magic The Gathering card art, stylized chaos, dark and moody atmosphere."

**Option 3 (Simple & Symbolic):**

"A single, cracked game beverage bottle overflowing with darkness, a stylized silhouette of a creature fading into shadow, stark black and white, Magic The Gathering card art, minimalist design, impactful composition."

**Option 4 (More Direct - Good for Consistency):**

"Magic The Gathering card art: A sorcerer casting a dark spell that causes life loss, hand discard, and creature sacrifice, chaotic energy, dramatic lighting, high detail, fantasy."
