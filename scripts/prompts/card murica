A dynamic, gritty illustration of a muscular, heavily tattooed American soldier in a worn-out camouflage uniform, mid-action firing a rifle, surrounded by a hazy explosion of smoke and shattered crates, with a defiant grin, in the style of a vintage war poster, dramatic lighting, cinematic, 1940s aesthetic, detailed textures, splash art.
