A highly detailed, slightly comical illustration of a grumpy Rum Crab, clutching a miniature tankard overflowing with dark rum, standing on a small, moss-covered island amidst a turbulent, stormy sea.  Raindrops and swirling foam surround the crab, reflecting a sickly green glow. Style: Fantasy art, slightly painterly, emphasizing texture and mood.
