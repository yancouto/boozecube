A vibrant, slightly surreal Magic: The Gathering card art depicting an ornate enchantment – a swirling vortex of legal documents and gold coins – with three prominent bill counters embedded within it, radiating a shimmering, golden light; a hand reaches out to grasp a single bill, with a hazy, ethereal effect suggesting card draw and a drink, emphasizing the cyclical nature of the enchantment’s ability.
