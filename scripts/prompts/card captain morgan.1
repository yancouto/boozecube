A dramatic, cinematic illustration of Captain Morgan, a weathered and imposing planeswalker, standing on the deck of a pirate ship amidst a raging storm. He holds a tankard overflowing with blue liquid, a mischievous grin on his face. Around him, spectral pirate ship tokens (4/3 with islandhome) attack, and energy crackles in the air. Style: m15-mainframe-planeswalker, detailed, stormy seas, blue energy, pirate theme, cinematic lighting, art old.
