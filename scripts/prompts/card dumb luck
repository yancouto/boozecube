A dramatic, unsettling illustration depicting a swirling vortex of dice and arcane symbols, with a single, glowing eye peering out from the center – a vaguely humanoid face contorted in a grimace – casting a sickly green light upon a crumbling, ancient stone altar. The altar is littered with discarded dice and spectral figures, all bathed in an unsettling, ethereal glow, style of May the Old Ones, detailed, evocative, magical realism.
