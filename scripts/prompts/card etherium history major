A dynamic, slightly stylized illustration of a hulking, weathered artifact resembling a giant, ornate beer stein overflowing with swirling, iridescent ether, a young, slightly disheveled "fratboy" figure (a young man with messy hair and a slightly glazed-over expression) stands proudly beside it, clutching a tankard, with the tagline "Halt, bro" subtly overlaid in a gritty, aged font.  Art old style, magical artifact, creature, ethereal, detailed, vibrant colors, 2025 aesthetic.
