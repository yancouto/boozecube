A dynamic, slightly hazy illustration of a towering, metallic Eldrazi Drone Fratboy named "It That Parties," surrounded by glowing pledge tokens, all subtly transformed into miniature Fratboys, with a jovial, slightly chaotic expression. The art style is reminiscent of Cool Hedron's work, with a focus on aged metal textures and a hazy, energetic atmosphere â€“ 2WW creature, 4/4, Fratboy.
