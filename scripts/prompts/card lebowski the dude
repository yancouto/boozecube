A cinematic, slightly hazy painting of Lebowski, the Dude, sprawled casually on a worn velvet couch in a brightly lit, slightly chaotic living room, a half-full glass of White Russian in his hand, a look of blissful indifference on his face, hexproof aura subtly glowing, art in the style of a vintage 70s movie poster, detailed textures, soft lighting, 8k, octane render.
