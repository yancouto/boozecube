A vibrant, slightly stylized illustration of five iridescent, jewel-toned lizards - emerald, sapphire, ruby, amethyst, and topaz - lounging on a mossy stone table in a dimly lit, opulent tavern. One lizard holds a miniature goblet overflowing with shimmering liquid. The lizards are relaxed and almost smug, with a subtle “boozetouch” effect radiating outwards. Dramatic lighting, detailed tavern background, magical glow, fantasy art, Magic The Gathering card art.
