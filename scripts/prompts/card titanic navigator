A dynamic, painterly illustration of a grizzled, muscular human pirate – the Titanic Navigator – standing on the deck of a crumbling, ice-covered ship. He’s brandishing a cutlass, a furious expression on his face, with a stormy sea and a distant, ominous iceberg looming in the background. Style: Dramatic, painterly, reminiscent of classic nautical art, with a slightly chaotic and unsettling feel.
