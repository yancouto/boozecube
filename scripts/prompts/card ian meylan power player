A highly detailed, slightly surreal painting of a weathered, intense human psychiatrist – Ian Meylan – standing in a dimly lit, cluttered office filled with overflowing bookshelves and scattered patient charts. He has a focused, almost manic expression, holding a small, ornate syringe. Rain streaks down the windows. Style: dramatic lighting, detailed textures, slightly unsettling, inspired by Ian McQue.
