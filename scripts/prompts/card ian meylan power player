A detailed and slightly surreal painting of a weary but intense human psychiatrist, Ian Meylan, standing in a dimly lit, cluttered office filled with overflowing bookshelves and anatomical models. He’s mid-sentence, gesturing with a hand, a troubled expression on his face. A faint, swirling blue energy subtly emanates from his hands, reflecting the “Creature Spells you cast cost 3 less to cast” ability. Style: Dramatic lighting, painterly style, reminiscent of Ian McQue, with a touch of psychological horror.
