A dynamic, painterly illustration of a monstrous, four-headed beast, the Parched Baloth, mid-stride amidst a hazy, cracked desert landscape. Steam rises from its gaping maws, and a spilled game beverage – dice, cups, and tokens – lies scattered around it, reflecting a desperate, chaotic energy. Style: Dramatic fantasy art, detailed textures, rim lighting.
