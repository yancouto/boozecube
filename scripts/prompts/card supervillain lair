Dramatic, highly detailed fantasy art depicting a towering, partially submerged island swamp dominated by a sinister, obsidian-like structure â€“ a vast, ruined villain's lair. Glowing purple and black energy pulses from the structure, casting an eerie light on twisted cypress trees and murky water. Ozymandias, a powerfully built villain with a cruel expression and ornate armor, stands at the entrance, gesturing dramatically with a hand.  Rain and a sickly green glow permeate the scene, emphasizing a sense of oppressive power and threat.  Painterly style, epic fantasy, dark tones, cinematic lighting.
