A chaotic, vibrant illustration of goblins—some grinning maliciously, others with wide, eager eyes—surrounding a central, ornate table laden with cards and dice.  Several players, diverse and slightly cartoonish, are reacting with surprise, delight, or horror.  The goblins are actively manipulating the cards, with some tossing them in the air and others grabbing them with glee.  Style:  Dramatic lighting, slightly aged parchment texture, reminiscent of an old magical illustration, painterly style, focus on emotion and action.
