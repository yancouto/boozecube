A colossal, ornate steampunk vehicle, the Caminhorote, dominates a rain-slicked, gaslit cityscape at night. The vehicle, a towering brass and copper monstrosity with multiple rotating gears and visible steam vents, is mid-charge, leaving a trail of sparks.  A swirling, hazy aura of intoxication surrounds it.  Detailed, cinematic, dramatic lighting, art by VRUM VRUM, magic the gathering card art.
