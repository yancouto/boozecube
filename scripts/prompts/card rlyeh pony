A highly detailed, unsettling digital painting of a R'lyeh Pony - a spectral horse horror emerging from a swirling, phosphorescent ocean, tentacles subtly visible beneath the surface, glowing with an eerie blue light, reminiscent of the city of R'lyeh, wings partially unfurled, lifelink effect, dynamic pose, vibrant colors, art by Greg Rutkowski.
