A dynamic, slightly grotesque illustration of a trio of undead zombie prostitutes, each with a glazed-over expression and decaying features, leaning against a dimly lit, gothic tavern interior. One raises a skeletal hand as if offering a drink, while another clutches a rusty dagger. Withered vines and dark energy swirl around them, with subtle "Boozetouch" iconography (a spilled tankard) in the background. Detailed, gritty, cinematic lighting, Magic The Gathering art style.
