Here are a few prompt options for Stable Diffusion, varying in detail and style, based on the "Go Figure" card description:

**Option 1 (Detailed & Dramatic):**

"A swirling vortex of smoky grey and purple, a shadowy figure resembling a distorted mannequin stands at the center, extending a hand towards a horrified player whose cards are vanishing into the vortex, dramatic lighting, magic effect, fantasy illustration, intricate details, Magic The Gathering art."

**Option 2 (Stylized & Simple):**

"Stylized illustration of a mannequin casting a spell, cards swirling around it in a chaotic vortex, Magic The Gathering card art, vibrant colors, dynamic composition, clean lines, fantasy."

**Option 3 (Concise & Focused):**

"Mannequin casting a spell, cards vanishing into a vortex, Magic The Gathering card art, dynamic lighting, fantasy, sorcery effect."

**Option 4 (More evocative, leaning into the name):**

"A strangely posed mannequin, bathed in ethereal purple light, causing a chaotic cascade of discarded cards around a distraught player, surreal fantasy illustration, Magic The Gathering card art, dramatic lighting, intricate details."
