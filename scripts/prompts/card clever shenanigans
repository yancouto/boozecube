A vibrant, slightly chaotic illustration of a wizard casting an instant spell â€“ swirling purple and teal energy erupting from their hands, with a cartoonish, slightly tipsy figure (representing the "drinks 3" effect) in the foreground, surrounded by miniature, exasperated figures with water spilling from their mouths, in a style reminiscent of classic Magic The Gathering artwork.
