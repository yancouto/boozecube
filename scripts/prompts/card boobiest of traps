Here are a few prompt options for Stable Diffusion, ranging in style and detail, based on the "Boobiest of Traps" card description:

**Option 1 (Detailed & Thematic - leaning into the humor):**

"A highly detailed, slightly grotesque artifact trap resembling a rusted, Victorian-era contraption overflowing with brightly colored, cartoonish booby traps and comical explosives, a mischievous imp grinning from the center, dramatic lighting, sharp focus, vibrant colors, magical realism, inspired by Wayne Barlowe, cinematic composition"

**Option 2 (Stylized & Simplified - leaning into the chaotic trap aspect):**

"A chaotic and stylized artifact trap exploding with brightly colored booby traps, a swirling vortex of dynamite and springs, cartoonish design, vibrant colors, dynamic composition, graphic novel style, highly detailed, magic the gathering card art"

**Option 3 (Simple & Direct - for a cleaner, more illustrative look):**

"A gleaming, steampunk-inspired artifact trap overflowing with various booby traps - springs, nets, smoke bombs - against a backdrop of a dimly lit dungeon, dramatic lighting, clean lines, graphic design, magic the gathering card illustration"

**Option 4 (Short & Sweet - for a quick generation):**

"Artifact trap overflowing with booby traps, cartoonish, magical realism, magic the gathering card art, vibrant colors"
