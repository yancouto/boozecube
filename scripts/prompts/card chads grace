A vibrant, slightly chaotic illustration of a burly, grinning fratboy mid-chug of a beer, surrounded by swirling white "Pledge" creature tokens, with the card text “Chug a beer: Create a 2/2 white Pledge creature token. Whenever you chug a beer, creatures you control get +2/+2 and indestructible until end of turn,” rendered in a bold, saturated style, evoking a college party atmosphere.
