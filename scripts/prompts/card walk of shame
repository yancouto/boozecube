A dramatic, slightly stylized illustration depicting a towering, ornate, crumbling archway – the "Walk of Shame" – casting a long, melancholic shadow. Within the archway, a shadowy, spectral figure in a Victorian-era waistcoat and top hat drinks from a glittering, overflowing goblet, surrounded by shadowy creatures bearing shame counters etched onto their bodies, rendered in a slightly aged, sepia-toned aesthetic reminiscent of a vintage theatrical poster.
