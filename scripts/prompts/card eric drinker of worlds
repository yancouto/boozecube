Detailed, painterly illustration of a chaotic, grinning humanoid wizard named Eric, overflowing with swirling, iridescent orbs representing drinks, standing amidst a shattered, ancient temple. Heâ€™s wearing tattered robes and a manic expression, with a single, oversized goblet spilling with a sickly-sweet, luminescent liquid. Dramatic lighting, aged parchment textures, and a slightly surreal, unsettling vibe, reminiscent of a forgotten, desperate wizard's workshop.
