A detailed illustration of a bulbous, colorful Homarid bartender, the Kleav’land Steamer, standing behind a weathered wooden bar in a smoky, dimly lit tavern. He’s pouring a steaming mug of something (perhaps bubbling potion) while several shadowy figures drink, with a hazy, old-world aesthetic and a slightly stylized, almost painterly look, evoking a classic Magic The Gathering card.
