Here are a few prompt options, ranging from more detailed to simpler, suitable for Stable Diffusion, based on the Gimli card description:

**Option 1 (Detailed):**

"Epic fantasy art, Gimli, Son of Gloin, a powerfully built dwarf warrior with a braided beard and axe, mid-battle, striking with furious speed, surrounded by spilled ale and stunned opponents, dramatic lighting, dynamic pose, cinematic, highly detailed, art by Greg Rutkowski and Brom"

**Option 2 (Medium Detail):**

"Illustration of Gimli, Son of Gloin, a dwarf warrior with an axe, drinking heavily and delivering a double strike, surrounded by intoxicated players, intricate details, fantasy art, vibrant colors, heroic pose"

**Option 3 (Simple):**

"Gimli, Son of Gloin, dwarf warrior with axe, drinking heavily, double strike, fantastical fantasy art"

**Option 4 (Stylized - leaning into the "nobody tosses a dwarf" aspect):**

"A miniature, almost toy-like illustration of Gimli, Son of Gloin, a stout dwarf warrior holding a tankard overflowing with ale, striking an opponent with an axe, whimsical fantasy art, bright colors, cartoonish style"

**Key Considerations for Stable Diffusion:**

*   **Keywords:**  "Fantasy art," "dwarf," "warrior," "axe," "double strike," "intoxicated" are all crucial.
*   **Artist Styles:** Adding artist names (e.g., Greg Rutkowski, Brom) can heavily influence the style.
*   **Detail Level:** Adjust the prompt to specify how much detail you want (e.g., "highly detailed," "intricate details").
*   **Color Palette:** You could add specific color instructions if desired (e.g., "warm colors," "vibrant colors").

To help me refine the prompt even further, could you tell me:

*   What kind of overall artistic style are you going for (e.g., realistic, painterly, comic book, stylized)?
