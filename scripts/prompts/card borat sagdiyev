A vibrant, slightly chaotic illustration of Borat Sagdiyev, a muscular, heavily accented human with a bewildered expression, wielding a large, ornate metal hand, radiating golden energy, standing amidst a desolate, metallic Mirrodin landscape, reminiscent of a surrealist painting with bold colors and dramatic lighting, inspired by Terry Gilliam and Rackam's Cardboard Cities, "draw two cards" effect subtly visualized as shimmering duplicates of himself.
