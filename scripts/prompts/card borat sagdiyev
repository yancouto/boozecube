Legendary creature art: Borat Sagdiyev, a powerfully built, slightly sweaty human with a thick mustache and wildly enthusiastic expression, standing amidst a chaotic scene of metallic fragments and discarded mirrors on a ruined Mirrodin landscape. He's mid-high-five with a shocked, slightly suggestive pose and a quote bubble reading "On Mirrodin, everyone has metal body partsâ€¦" Rendered in a gritty, slightly surreal style, reminiscent of old comic book art, emphasizing texture and detail.
