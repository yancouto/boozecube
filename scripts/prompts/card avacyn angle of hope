Dramatic, painterly art of Avacyn, Angle of Hope, a radiant, angelic warrior with flowing white robes, holding a gleaming sword aloft, surrounded by a swirling vortex of geometrically perfect triangles glowing with holy light, a sense of serene power and protection, detailed texture, epic scale, inspired by Greg Rutkowski and Brom.
