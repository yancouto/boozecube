A hauntingly beautiful sorcery card art depicting a solitary figure, cloaked in shadow, sitting at a rain-slicked wooden table in a dimly lit tavern, surrounded by shattered glasses and overturned chairs, with spectral, distorted reflections of fallen creatures swirling around them, evocative of an old, painterly style, dramatic lighting, detailed textures, 2025 art style.
