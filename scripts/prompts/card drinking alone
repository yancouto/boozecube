Here are a few Stable Diffusion prompts based on the "Drinking Alone" card, ranging in style and detail:

**Option 1 (Detailed & Dramatic):**

"A swirling, smoky depiction of a solitary figure slumped at a weathered wooden table, a half-empty glass of crimson liquid before them. Around the figure, spectral, translucent versions of destroyed creatures swirl and dissipate, illuminated by an eerie red glow. Dramatic lighting, cinematic, Magic The Gathering art, detailed, high fantasy."

**Option 2 (Stylized & Evocative):**

"A moody, painterly image of a lone figure drinking in a dimly lit tavern. Shattered remnants of various creatures float around them in a vortex of red and black energy.  Magic The Gathering card art, stylistic, evocative, intense colors, fantasy illustration."

**Option 3 (Simple & Direct):**

"A sorcery card illustration: A solitary figure drinking from a glass, surrounded by disintegrating creatures. Red energy, Magic The Gathering style, bold colors, clear lines."

**Option 4 (Short & Focused):**

"Magic The Gathering card art: ‘Drinking Alone’ – A lone figure surrounded by destroyed creatures, red energy, spell effect." 

**To help me refine the prompt further, could you tell me:**
