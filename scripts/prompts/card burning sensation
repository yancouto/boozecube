Here are a few Stable Diffusion prompts based on the "Burning Sensation" card description, ranging in style and detail:

**Option 1 (Detailed, evocative):**

"Dynamic illustration of Chandra Nalaar, a fierce planar mage with fiery red hair and eyes, unleashing a brilliant, chaotic burst of orange and crimson energy from her hands, striking a humanoid creature with a searing flash. Sparks fly, smoke billows, a sense of raw power and imminent destruction. Ravnica cityscape subtly visible in the background. Cinematic lighting, detailed textures, fantasy art."

**Option 2 (Stylized, dramatic):**

"Chandra Nalaar mid-cast, unleashing a fiery blast of orange and red, with a coin spinning in the air, reflected in her eye.  Dramatic lighting, volumetric lighting, painterly style, fantasy art, intricate details, heroic pose."

**Option 3 (Simple, impactful):**

"Chandra Nalaar casting a fiery instant, orange and red energy emanating from her hand. Coin flip in the air.  Fantasy illustration, clean lines, bold colors, magical effect, dynamic composition."

**Option 4 (Short & Direct - for quick generation):**

"Chandra Nalaar casting 'Burning Sensation', orange and red energy, coin flip, Ravnica, fantasy art."

**Note:**  The inclusion of "The Internet is for Porn" as the illustrator is unlikely to influence the image positively, so I've focused on descriptive elements related to the card's effect and flavor text.  You may want to adjust these prompts based on your preferred Stable Diffusion model and settings.
