A dynamic, slightly psychedelic painting of a tall, lean elf, Nath of the Weed-Leaf, leaning back with a blissful, hazy expression, surrounded by swirling green smoke and glowing cannabis leaves. Heâ€™s casually holding a small, ornate bong. Several 1/1 green Elf Warrior tokens swirl around him, and a faint green aura pulses from him, depicting the effects of taking a shot. Style: Vibrant, slightly surreal, painterly, magical realism.
