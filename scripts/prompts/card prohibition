A dramatic, slightly grainy oil painting depicting a dimly lit tavern scene at dusk. A worn, ornate enchantment card – "Prohibition" – floats mid-air, partially obscured by swirling smoke and the shadows of revelers. Several players are depicted mid-action: one raising a glass for a chug, another reaching to sacrifice the enchantment with a dagger. The overall mood is one of reckless abandon and impending doom, heavy with the scent of ale and impending loss. Art old style.
