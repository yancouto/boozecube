Here's a Stable Diffusion prompt based on the Magic The Gathering card description, aiming for a stylized and evocative image:

**"A vibrant, slightly hazy illustration of a young woman in a retro 80s-inspired dress, leaning against a vintage train car, belting out a song with a microphone, surrounded by a swirling vortex of returned cards rising from a graveyard, bokeh lighting, pop art style, 80s synthwave colors, dynamic pose, Magic The Gathering card art."**
