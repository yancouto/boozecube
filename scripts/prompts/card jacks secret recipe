A dramatic, cinematic illustration of a grizzled, slightly eccentric chef – Jack – holding a bubbling cauldron overflowing with a viscous, glowing potion. He’s wearing a stained apron and a mischievous grin, with a targeted hand reaching out towards a bewildered opponent’s hand, which is partially visible and radiating with a faint, chaotic energy. The art style is detailed and painterly, reminiscent of classic fantasy illustrations, with a focus on dynamic lighting and a sense of magical disruption.
