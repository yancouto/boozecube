A strikingly detailed, slightly stylized illustration of a towering, muscular Angel – the Morningwood Seraph – bathed in a warm, golden light. The Seraph has immense, powerful wings and a stern, indignant expression, clutching a miniature, ornate dagger.  Its design subtly evokes Serra Angel but leans heavily into a grumpy, troubled, almost aggressively protective demeanor.  Dark, thorny vines intertwine with the wings and body. Cinematic lighting, fantasy art, high detail.
