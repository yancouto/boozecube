A dramatically lit, highly detailed illustration of a young, slightly angry angel – a pale, muscular female angel with feathered wings and a fierce expression – standing in a shadowy, overgrown forest clearing, clutching a small, tarnished silver dagger, with vibrant, slightly unsettling light filtering through the trees, reminiscent of old master paintings, art by Like Serra Angel but with daddy issues, 2025 style.
