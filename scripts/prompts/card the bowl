A highly detailed, dramatic illustration of a weathered bronze bowl overflowing with shimmering, spectral dice – each dice glowing with a faint, ethereal blue light – set against a dark, stormy sky. Weight counters, represented as small, tarnished iron disks, are visibly piled upon the bowl, with a single, dramatic spotlight illuminating the scene, invoking a sense of tense anticipation and impending action, in the style of a classic Magic The Gathering illustration by Samwise Didier.
