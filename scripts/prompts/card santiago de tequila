A detailed, slightly surreal illustration of a vibrant, ancient Tequila forest with glowing, swirling blue and green liquid rising from the roots, representing the mana, with a weathered, ornate stone fountain in the center pouring the liquid into a stylized, swirling vortex, all rendered in a slightly painterly style, reminiscent of sasasasa's work, evoking a sense of potent, magical energy, and the card name "Santiago de Tequila" subtly overlaid.
