Here are a few Stable Diffusion prompts based on the "Hotboxed Van" card description, ranging in style and detail:

**Option 1 (Detailed & Dramatic):**

"A gritty, cinematic illustration of a vintage, beat-up van, engulfed in a swirling, neon pink and blue explosion of exhaust and flames. The van is partially submerged in the chaos, a distorted reflection of a city skyline visible through the shattered windshield.  Motion blur, intense color,  Magic The Gathering card art, dramatic lighting, detailed textures, high resolution."

**Option 2 (Stylized & Graphic):**

"A bold, graphic illustration of a classic van blasting through a brightly colored, distorted cityscape.  Geometric shapes, neon colors, halftone pattern, Magic The Gathering card art, dynamic composition,  vibrant, high contrast, stylized."

**Option 3 (Simple & Clean):**

"A clean, minimalist illustration of a classic van with a burst of stylized, fiery energy emanating from it.  Flat colors, strong lines, Magic The Gathering card art, bright palette, impactful, sharp focus."

**Option 4 (More Narrative):**

"A frantic scene depicting a hotboxed van speeding through a chaotic, urban landscape.  Explosions of color and light surround the vehicle, with a sense of urgency and movement. Magic The Gathering card art, dynamic pose,  detailed vehicle, strong colors, cinematic."
