A hyperrealistic, slightly unsettling painting of a vast, bioluminescent swamp forest, dominated by towering, fleshy trees with glowing blue roots, a single, cracked stone path winding through the undergrowth, and a subtle, pale green tint suggesting organic growth, with a single, stylized hourglass symbol subtly integrated into the landscape - Stable Diffusion, detailed, atmospheric, magical realism.
