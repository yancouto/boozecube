A highly detailed, slightly stylized illustration of a grizzled, nerdy pirate – “Neckbeard” – clutching a tankard overflowing with ale, surrounded by a swirling, hazy mist of beer foam. He’s wearing a worn pirate hat and mismatched clothing, with a fierce but slightly bewildered expression.  Around him, miniature, stylized pirate ships with tiny tankards appear to be sailing, and faint, glowing effects suggest “boozetouch.”  Art old style, intricate detail, cinematic lighting, fantasy illustration.
