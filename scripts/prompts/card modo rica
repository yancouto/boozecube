A dramatic, swirling illustration of a cloaked figure (Modo Rica) channeling chaotic green and red energy, surrounded by a vortex of cards being shuffled and flipped, with a sense of reckless power and a shadowy hand reaching out to grab a card – vibrant colors, dynamic composition, magical realism, cinematic lighting, intricate details – style of Greg Rutkowski.
