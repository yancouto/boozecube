Dramatic, slightly blurry close-up portrait of a bewildered, middle-aged man in a slightly rumpled suit, holding a pistol loosely, a bewildered expression on his face, with a slight smear of blood on the barrel. Soft, muted colors, reminiscent of an old photograph, with a subtle film grain effect, evoking a sense of awkward regret and a punch in the arm implied by a slight recoil.
