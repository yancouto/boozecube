A weathered, antique-style illustration of a massive, brass and copper construct resembling a human hand, Edward Fortyhands, holding a frothy beer stein. Two glowing blue counters are prominently displayed on its palm. The background is a dimly lit, brick-walled tavern, with a sense of age and history.  Art old, detailed, dramatic lighting, 2025 style.
