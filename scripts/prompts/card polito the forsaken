A dynamic, gritty illustration of Polito, the Forsaken, a young, slightly disheveled fratboy assassin, mid-action as he delivers a precise strike with a dagger, surrounded by empty beer bottles and shot glasses, with a faint red glow emanating from him, in the style of a Mi xombre es Polo painting, emphasizing detail and a slightly chaotic, old-school illustration aesthetic, 8k, dramatic lighting.
