Here's a Stable Diffusion prompt based on the card description, aiming for a detailed and stylish illustration:

**"A dynamic, cinematic illustration of Polito, the Forsaken, a young, heavily tattooed red-haired fratboy assassin, mid-action with a glowing red drink in his hand, surrounded by shattered remains of a fallen creature, redemption counters swirling around him, vibrant red and black color palette, Mi xombre es Polo style, cinematic lighting, dramatic pose, detailed textures, Magic The Gathering art style."**

I've tried to capture the key elements of the card – the fratboy aesthetic, the action, the redemption counters, and the overall magical feel.  The "Mi xombre es Polo style" is included to lean into the illustrator’s name.
