A dynamic, painterly illustration of Amanda, Enemy of the End, a weathered human druid figure, surrounded by swirling, aged energy, growing larger and more imposing as it gains age counters, with a powerful, slightly crazed expression, detailed leather armor and tribal markings, reminiscent of a Celtic warrior meeting a druid, magical age counters glowing around her, vibrant greens and browns, epic fantasy art, high detail.
