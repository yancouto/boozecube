Here's a Stable Diffusion prompt based on the Magic: The Gathering card description, aiming for a detailed and evocative image:

**"A swirling, vibrant sorcery card titled 'Afternoon Delight'.  Dramatic, stylized sky rockets burst upwards from a swirling, emerald green magical vortex, illuminating a hazy, golden afternoon. The card itself is a textured parchment, with glowing green runes and a subtly distressed edge.  Detailed, magical, fantasy, dramatic lighting, common card art."**

**Notes on why this prompt was created:**

*   **Descriptive Language:** Uses evocative language (swirling, vibrant, dramatic) to guide the AI.
*   **Specific Elements:** Includes all the key elements: the title, the rockets, the color scheme, the card texture.
*   **Art Style Keywords:** "Detailed, magical, fantasy" are included to lean towards a visually rich style.
*   **Card Art Style:** "Common card art" gives the AI an idea of the overall aesthetic to aim for.

To adjust the prompt, you could specify a particular art style (e.g., "art nouveau," "digital painting," "concept art") or add details about the lighting (e.g., "rim lighting," "volumetric lighting").
