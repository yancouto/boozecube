A dynamic, painterly illustration of a stoic, silver-armored human knight, clad in weathered leather and chainmail, standing defiantly amidst a swirling, ethereal mist. He holds a gleaming, ornate glass bottle aloft, a faint blue glow emanating from within. Around him, spectral knights flicker, and the background is a muted, ancient stone courtyard bathed in twilight. Style: Old Master Painting, detailed, dramatic lighting, first strike effect emphasized with glowing outlines, inspired by Frank Frazetta and classical fantasy art.
