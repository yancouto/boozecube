A highly detailed and slightly unsettling painting in the style of an old alchemist’s illustration: a swirling, hazy laboratory filled with bubbling beakers, strange glowing concoctions, and various intoxicated creatures – goblins, apes, and humanoid figures – all dripping with colorful, viscous liquids; a single, ornate glass alembic dominates the center, glowing with an eerie green light; the overall color palette is dark green, brown, and amber, with a subtle, almost psychedelic haze; art old, magic the gathering card, mass intoxication, enchantment.
