A whimsical, slightly chaotic illustration of three Ooompa Loompas, stout dwarves with exaggerated features, gleefully smashing a glowing, ornate artifact with crude wooden clubs â€“ art style: old, slightly painterly, reminiscent of 19th-century illustration, bright and saturated colors, dynamic pose, focusing on the destruction, with a hint of derpiness.
