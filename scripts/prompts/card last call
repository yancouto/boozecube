A dramatic, cinematic instant card art: A shadowy figure in a Victorian-era gentleman's attire stands at a dimly lit bar, raising a glass overflowing with crimson liquid, a single spotlight illuminating him, swirling smoke and spectral images of past selves flickering around him, detailed textures of aged wood, brass, and swirling liquid, high contrast, volumetric lighting, moody atmosphere, reminiscent of a noir film still, Magic The Gathering art style.
