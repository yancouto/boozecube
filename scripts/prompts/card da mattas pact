A detailed, slightly surreal illustration of an elderly man, resembling a slightly crazed brewmaster named Da Matta, standing amidst a chaotic scene of overflowing beer barrels and shimmering magical energy. He's gesturing with a weathered hand towards several options: a swirling vortex of beer, a hand reaching into a library, and a glowing hand offering a life-restoring draught.  Art style: Old master painting, dramatic lighting, intricate details, slightly unsettling, 2025 aesthetic.
