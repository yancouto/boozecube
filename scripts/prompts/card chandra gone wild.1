A dynamic, painterly illustration of Chandra, Gone Wild, a powerful planeswalker with fiery red and orange energy swirling around her, mid-battle, casting a bolt of lightning with a crazed, ecstatic expression â€“ she's surrounded by exploding magical runes and a chaotic scene of destruction and wild joy, reminiscent of a MUSHROOM cloud, with a vibrant, slightly surreal, m15-mainframe style, painterly brushstrokes, 8k, highly detailed.
