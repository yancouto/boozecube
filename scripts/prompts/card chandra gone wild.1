A dynamic, painterly illustration of Chandra, Gone Wild, a fiery, chaotic planeswalker with wild, unbound hair and intense eyes, surrounded by exploding embers and miniature, frantic elemental creatures. She's mid-casting a spell, a bolt of crackling energy arcing from her hand, with a crazed expression. The background is a swirling vortex of burnt orange and crimson, with a touch of aged, distressed paper texture evocative of an old map or scroll. Cinematic lighting, painterly style, m15-mainframe-planeswalker aesthetic, vibrant colors, detailed textures, evocative of a lost and found art style.
