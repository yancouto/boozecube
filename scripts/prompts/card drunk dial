A chaotic, vibrant illustration of a disheveled wizard, eyes glazed over, frantically dialing a glowing, spectral phone. Around him swirl distorted reflections of a suburban living room, with a scattering of dice and discarded mana symbols. The phone itself is a swirling vortex of purple and green energy. Style: stylized, slightly surreal, reminiscent of classic Magic art with a modern, energetic feel.
