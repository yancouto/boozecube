A highly detailed, slightly aged, sepia-toned illustration of a glass bottle overflowing with swirling, iridescent liquid, emitting a hazy, ethereal glow. The bottle sits on a worn wooden table with a single flickering candle nearby.  Boozetouch runes are subtly etched into the bottleâ€™s surface.  Stylized, slightly whimsical, old-fashioned magic effects emanate from the bottle, transforming a small, spectral creature into a fearsome dragon.  Magic The Gathering card art.
