A stunning, slightly aged illustration of a shadowy tavern scene, overflowing with boisterous, slightly inebriated humanoids – warriors, wizards, and beastfolk – all raising tankards of ale. A shimmering, golden aura emanates from a large, ornate enchantment symbol hovering above the bar, subtly altering the light and casting elongated, distorted shadows. Detailed background with worn wooden tables, spilled ale, and flickering candlelight. Style: detailed fantasy art, evocative lighting, a hint of old-world charm, painterly.
