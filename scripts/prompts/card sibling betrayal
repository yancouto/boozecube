Dramatic, stylized illustration of a young, conflicted-looking man (representing the card's name) with a hardened expression, holding a dagger, standing in shadow with a single spotlight illuminating him as he stares intensely at a fading image of a man in a suit (representing betrayal), with a hazy, distressed background suggesting a family gathering, dark and gritty art style, reminiscent of classic film noir, detailed textures, sharp focus.
