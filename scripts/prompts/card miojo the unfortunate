A highly detailed, painterly illustration of Miojo, the Unfortunate, a weary-looking, slightly shambling humanoid planeswalker with a perpetually sad expression, standing in a crumbling, overgrown temple interior bathed in a muted, dusty light. He wears simple, worn robes and clutches a small, cracked clay figurine. The overall style should evoke an old m15-mainframe aesthetic, with a focus on texture and mood â€“ think aged paper, moss, and a sense of impending doom. Dramatic lighting, muted colors (browns, grays, faded blues), and a slightly unsettling atmosphere.
