A chaotic, vibrant illustration of a swirling, crimson enchantment card titled "Caralho! Corre, Ruas!" depicting a frantic, stylized depiction of a stampede of diverse creatures – wolves, goblins, even a dragon – bursting from a crack in the earth, with a screaming, stylized figure yelling "Caralho! Corre, Ruas!" in bold, graffiti-style text.  Dynamic action lines and a sense of urgent movement.
