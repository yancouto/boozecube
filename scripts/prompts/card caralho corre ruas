A frantic, slightly chaotic scene depicting a weathered, hand-painted illustration in the style of an old pulp adventure poster. A determined, slightly crazed adventurer, covered in mud and clutching a map, shouts "Caralho! Corre, Ruas!" with wide eyes, pointing towards a swirling vortex of fleeing creatures—a velociraptor, a griffin, and a cyclops—all rendered in a slightly naive but energetic style, with a distressed, aged paper texture and heavy ink lines.
