A vibrant and whimsical sorcery card art depicting a circle of diverse creatures – some friendly woodland sprites and playful animal companions, others shadowy, unsettling figures – surrounding a central, glowing emerald orb. The overall style is painterly and detailed, with a touch of magical realism, emphasizing the dual nature of the card's effect.
