A dramatic, slightly stylized illustration of Sabrina Vance, a young woman with dark hair and piercing eyes, standing in a dimly lit, opulent chamber filled with swirling arcane energy. She holds a silver pendant glowing with purple light, and in the foreground, a shadowy, spectral wolf kneels before her, poised to attack. The artwork evokes a sense of magical contract and imminent action, with a focus on Sabrina's intense gaze and the unsettling beauty of the wolf.
