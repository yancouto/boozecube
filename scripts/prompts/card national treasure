Here's a Stable Diffusion prompt based on the "National Treasure" card description, aiming for a visually striking and thematic image:

**"A majestic, ancient stone fountain overflowing with iridescent, swirling mana of all colors, glowing with an ethereal light, framed by crumbling, moss-covered ruins and a single, watchful golden eye subtly embedded in the stone, dramatic lighting, fantasy art, Magic The Gathering, highly detailed, epic scale"**

**Explanation of Choices:**

*   **"A majestic, ancient stone fountain overflowing with iridescent, swirling mana..."** - Directly addresses the core mechanics and visual of the card.
*   **"iridescent, swirling mana of all colors"** - Captures the infinite mana effect.
*   **"crumbling, moss-covered ruins"** -  Adds to the "treasure" and "legendary land" feel.
*   **"a single, watchful golden eye subtly embedded in the stone"** - Incorporates the subtle effect.
*   **"dramatic lighting, fantasy art, Magic The Gathering"** –  Sets the artistic style and genre.
*   **"highly detailed, epic scale"** – Encourages a grand and impressive image.

You can adjust the prompt further (e.g., adding specific artists like "Greg Rutkowski" or changing the lighting) to fine-tune the output.
