A strikingly unsettling, close-up illustration of a small, demonic figure – a "Wifebeater Devil" – standing in a dimly lit, gritty alleyway. The devil is depicted with a sneering expression and crimson eyes, wearing a tattered, black wifebeater shirt. He’s wielding a single, rusty dagger, and around him are the ghostly outlines of recently slain creatures, with wisps of dark energy swirling, culminating in a visual representation of “drinking” – a spectral bottle partially filled with a viscous, crimson liquid.  Dark, oppressive atmosphere, detailed textures, dramatic lighting, inspired by old gothic horror art, B/R color palette.
