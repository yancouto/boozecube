A detailed, slightly aged illustration of a benevolent but stern-faced elderly wizard, radiating a soft blue light, enveloping a younger, slightly exasperated player in a shimmering aura. The player is seated at a wooden table, a half-empty glass of wine before him. The style leans towards classic fantasy art, reminiscent of 19th-century oil paintings, with a focus on warm tones and a sense of quiet authority.
