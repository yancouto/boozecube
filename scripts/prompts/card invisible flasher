A highly detailed, slightly unsettling and painterly illustration of a gaunt, pale human figure, partially visible in the shadows, with a lascivious smirk, rendered in a dark, old-fashioned style, reminiscent of 19th-century illustration, with a subtle bokeh effect suggesting unseen onlookers and a faint, hazy glow around him, conveying the "invisible" aspect and a suggestion of intoxication, emphasizing the "boozetouch" effect.
