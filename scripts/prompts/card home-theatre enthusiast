A highly detailed, cinematic illustration of a colossal, iridescent octopus inhabiting a luxurious, Victorian-era home theater - plush velvet seating, a gleaming projector, stacks of vinyl records, and a feeling of arcane knowledge and obsession. The octopus is subtly manipulating the controls of the projector with delicate, yet powerful, tentacles, radiating a soft, blue glow. Style: Victorian Steampunk, cinematic lighting, intricate detail, dark fantasy.
