A stylized, slightly grungy Magic: The Gathering Instant card illustration titled "A Two at Ten" and "A Ten at Two," depicting a shadowy figure in a dimly lit, old-fashioned bar, clutching a large glass overflowing with liquid (tequila), a weary expression on their face, with a faint, sickly green glow emanating from the drink, and a distressed, old-fashioned bar setting, m15-mainframe-dfc style, detailed, slightly unsettling.
