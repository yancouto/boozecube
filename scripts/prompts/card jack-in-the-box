A highly detailed, slightly surreal and whimsical digital painting of a rusty, antique jack-in-the-box overflowing with multicolored mana symbols (white, blue, black, red, green) and a frothy beer. A shadowy hand reaches from the box, holding a six-sided die. Bradâ€™s voice is subtly implied in the background.
