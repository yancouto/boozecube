A dramatically lit, gritty, close-up portrait of a shadowy, bat-like figure – “I’m Batman” – hovering over a kneeling, terrified creature, rendered in a painterly, old-fashioned style with heavy shadows and a single, piercing blue eye, evoking a sense of cold vengeance and dark magic, reminiscent of a 1940s noir illustration.
