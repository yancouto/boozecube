Here are a few Stable Diffusion prompts based on the Magic The Gathering card description, varying in style and detail:

**Option 1 (Detailed & Mystical):**

"A swirling, ethereal blue aura coalescing around a cute, chibi-style kitten named 'Keke,' glowing with faint magic, detailed background of a stylized arcane library, dramatic lighting, vibrant colors, magical realism, Magic The Gathering card art."

**Option 2 (Simple & Stylized):**

"Cute blue kitten 'Keke' radiating a simple, glowing aura, clean lines, bright and cheerful colors, Magic The Gathering card illustration, stylized magic."

**Option 3 (More Dramatic & Powerful):**

"A majestic blue 'Keke' creature, a radiant aura encompassing it, standing confidently, dynamic pose, swirling magical energy, dramatic lighting, illustration for a Magic The Gathering card, epic fantasy art."

**Option 4 (Short & Sweet):**

"Blue kitten 'Keke' with a glowing aura, Magic The Gathering card art, stylized, vibrant colors."

**Key considerations for your Stable Diffusion prompt:**

*   **"Magic The Gathering card art"**:  This is crucial to guide the AI towards the correct style and composition.
*   **"Keke"**:  Include the name of the card to reinforce the character's identity.
*   **"Blue"**: Be specific about the color.
*   **"Stylized" or "Detailed"**: Adjust this based on the desired level of detail.
*   **Additional keywords**: Feel free to add keywords like "epic," "fantasy," "magic," "illustration," "digital art," "bright colors," or "vibrant" to refine the output further.

To help me tailor the prompt even better, could you tell me:

*   What kind of art style are you going for (e.g., realistic, cartoonish, painterly, etc.)?
*   Are there any specific elements you'd like to emphasize (e.g., the aura, Keke's expression, the background)?
