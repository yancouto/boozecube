A majestic, slightly weathered island mountain rising from a turquoise sea, reminiscent of ancient Greek architecture - columns, arches, and a small, ornate bathhouse integrated into the stone. Sunlight streams through the clouds, casting a warm glow. Detailed, painterly style, inspired by Stephen RaffaÃ«l's art, evoking a sense of tranquility and ancient power.
