A breathtaking, stylized illustration of a volcanic island shrouded in mist, dominated by a swirling, turquoise whirlpool – the “Isle of Tortuga” – with a kraken-like form rising from the depths. Spectral blue energy pulses around the island, illuminating the scene. A towering, ancient pirate ship, partially submerged, is silhouetted against the whirlpool, and ghostly blue Pirate Ship tokens are emerging from the water, all set within a dramatic, painterly style.
