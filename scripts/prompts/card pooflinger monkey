A vibrant, slightly chaotic illustration of a muscular, brown monkey (the Pooflinger Monkey) mid-battle, swinging a small, comically oversized weapon, with a visible explosion of bubbles and faint, stylized fecal clouds emanating from its rear.  The style is slightly aged and painterly, reminiscent of an old illustration, with dynamic lighting and a touch of comical exaggeration, 2GG creature, jungle background, battle scene.
