A vibrant, slightly stylized illustration of a towering, ancient wooden bookshelf overflowing with lush, glowing green plants and arcane symbols. An elven druid, Tap Tap, stands at the base, gently tending to the shelves with a focused expression, a faint green glow emanating from the plants. The background is a misty, ancient forest. Magic The Gathering card art, 2025, detailed, fantasy.
