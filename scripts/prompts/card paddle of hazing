A detailed, slightly stylized illustration of a gleaming, chrome artifact paddle dripping with a swirling, golden viscous liquid resembling a Payoff drink, positioned on a weathered wooden table in a dimly lit fraternity house. A muscular Fratboy in a tank top and shorts is enthusiastically holding the paddle, with a faint glow emanating from it and a subtle outline of a second Fratboy in the background. The overall tone is slightly hazy and celebratory, with highlights emphasizing the liquid and the Fratboy's exertion.
