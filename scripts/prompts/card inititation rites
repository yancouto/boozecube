A highly detailed, slightly unsettling Magic The Gathering art piece depicting a cloaked figure in a dimly lit, ornate lodge room. Several young men, clad in pledge robes, are kneeling in various positions of submission, drinking from ornate goblets. The figure raises a hand, channeling arcane energy, with swirling magical effects surrounding them. Style: Dramatic, slightly surreal, evocative of ritualistic initiation.
