A highly detailed, slightly unsettling sorcery card illustration for "Initiation Rites" depicting a group of young men in formal robes and white shirts, kneeling in a dimly lit chamber, receiving a chilling instruction from an older, stern figure holding a ceremonial cup, with subtle hints of ritualistic symbols and an unsettlingly serious atmosphere, painted in a style reminiscent of an old engraving, dramatic lighting, 2025 art style.
