A chaotic, vibrant and slightly psychedelic painting of a lone, weathered wooden boat overflowing with colorful, animated buoys and splashing water, with a distorted, screaming face emerging from the waves, resembling a human but clearly influenced by the sea, in the style of a vintage pulp illustration, highly detailed, vibrant colors, dynamic lighting, 2025 style.
