**Option 3 (Simple & Conceptual):**

**Key Considerations for your prompt:**

*   **"Magic The Gathering"**: This is crucial to guide the AI toward the correct aesthetic.
*   **"Phyrexian"**:  Adding this ensures a specific color palette and visual style.
*   **Keywords**: Use terms like “instant”, “card art”, “digital painting”, “8k”, "cinematic" to refine the output.

To help me tailor the prompt even further, could you tell me:

*   What level of detail are you aiming for? (e.g., photorealistic, highly stylized, minimalist)
*   Do you have a preferred art style (e.g., Greg Rutkowski, Wayne Barlowe, Alphonse Mucha)?
