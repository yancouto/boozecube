A haunting, dimly lit swamp-plains landscape dominated by a crumbling, moss-covered stone church with a sickly green hue. Twisted cypress trees drip with an unnatural luminescence, and shadowy figures resembling cloaked clergy can be glimpsed within the decaying structure.  A subtle, swirling mist obscures the lower portions of the image, suggesting decay and a sense of unease.  Art style: Dark fantasy, atmospheric, detailed textures, evocative lighting.
