Ancient, weathered parchment depicting two smiling pirate figures - one a grizzled veteran with a tricorn hat, the other a youthful, eager mate - standing side-by-side on a stormy sea, one extending a hand in friendship, the other gesturing towards a distant ship, evoking a sense of classic nautical adventure and old magic, oil painting, dramatic lighting, high detail.
