Detailed, painterly illustration of a colossal, lumbering badger – "Milwaukee’s Beast" – erupting from a brewery, spilling ale and barrels, with a cheerful, slightly inebriated expression. The badger is covered in a hazy, golden boozy sheen, surrounded by happy, slightly blurry dwarves and humans celebrating. Style: Old Master painting, dramatic lighting, warm colors, gritty texture.
