A highly detailed, slightly whimsical illustration of a large, iridescent blue egg resting on a mossy forest floor, illuminated by dappled sunlight. Tiny, glowing ferns sprout around it.  At the egg's base, a faint, shimmering outline of a 6/6 green dinosaur token with trample is partially visible, suggesting a recent transformation.  Art style:  Stylized fantasy, reminiscent of classic Magic art with a touch of bioluminescence.
