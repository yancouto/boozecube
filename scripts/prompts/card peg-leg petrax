A detailed, painterly illustration of a stout, grizzled dwarf pirate, Peg-Leg Petrax, standing on a swaying ship deck amidst a raging storm. He wears a patched leather pirate hat, a scarred wooden leg, and carries a cutlass. Lightning flashes in the background. Focus on a gritty, realistic style, emphasizing texture and water effects. The illustration should convey a sense of chaotic action and dwarven resilience.
