A dynamic, painterly illustration of a stout, bearded Dwarf Pirate named Peg-Leg Petrax, standing on a rickety wooden dock amidst crashing waves, wielding a cutlass and a tankard overflowing with shimmering liquid, surrounded by ghostly copies of instants and sorceries erupting from his graveyard, in a style reminiscent of classic Magic art, dramatic lighting, highly detailed.
