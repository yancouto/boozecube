A hyperrealistic, slightly surreal illustration of a grizzled, heavily tattooed gnome named Zarthax, sitting at a worn wooden table in a dimly lit tavern, nursing a massive mug of malt liquor. Around him, spectral images of recently deceased creatures are faintly shimmering, each with a miniature mug of liquor appearing beside them. Malt Liquor illustration style, dark fantasy, detailed textures, cinematic lighting.
