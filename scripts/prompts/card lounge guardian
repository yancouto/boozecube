A strikingly detailed, gothic-horror illustration of a towering, muscular, stone-like bouncer creature - the Lounge Guardian - standing in a dimly lit, opulent bar filled with shadowy figures; the creature has glowing red eyes and a menacing expression; it has six massive arms and is surrounded by swirling smoke; Defender, deathtouch effect subtly implied through the scene; a single red glass of drink lies shattered at its feet; cinematic lighting, dramatic shadows, gritty textures, style of Brom.
