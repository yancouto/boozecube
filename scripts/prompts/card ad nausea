A dramatic, slightly surreal illustration of a grizzled, heavily scarred mercenary named Grax, holding a murky flask, about to take a large gulp. Beside him, a menacing, shadowy figure named Raâ€™akor observes with a predatory grin. The background is a dimly lit, chaotic tavern scene filled with grotesque figures and flickering torches, emphasizing a sense of desperation and imminent sickness, painted in a gritty, old-school fantasy style reminiscent of early Magic cards.
