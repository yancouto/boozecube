A detailed, slightly grotesque illustration of a swirling, sickly green enchantment card titled "Ad Nausea," depicting a shadowy, grotesque hand reaching out from a swirling vortex to force a creature to vomit, with a crazed, pirate-like face subtly visible within the vortex, reminiscent of a rakish, scarred buccaneer, in the style of a gritty Magic: The Gathering card art.
