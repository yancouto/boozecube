A vibrant, chaotic scene depicting a wine-soaked feast in a sun-drenched Greek temple, overflowing with revelers and overflowing wine pitchers, a swirling, spectral image of a drunken god (Dionysus) presiding over the revelry, intricate details of pottery, wine, and ecstatic faces, magical energy swirling around the scene, painterly style, dramatic lighting, inspired by Caravaggio and classical Greek art.
