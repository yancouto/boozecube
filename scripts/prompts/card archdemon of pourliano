A dramatic, cinematic illustration of a towering demon, the Archdemon of Pourliano, standing amidst a swirling, dark purple and crimson tavern scene filled with revelers spilling ale. The demon is powerfully built, radiating an aura of intoxicating chaos, with a crazed grin and eyes gleaming with dark glee.  Focus on dynamic lighting, a hazy, slightly blurred background of overflowing tables and boisterous figures, and the demon's wings partially obscured by smoke and ale.
