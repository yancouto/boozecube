Detailed, painterly illustration of a grizzled, old wizard frantically pouring a viscous, bubbling liquid (like a sickly green brew) from a clay flask, casting an instant spell called "Puke," with multiple targets – creatures – visibly recoiling in horror, illuminated by a dramatic, ethereal glow, m15-mainframe-dfc style, vintage Magic: The Gathering art.
