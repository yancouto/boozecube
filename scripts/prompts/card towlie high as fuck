A hyperrealistic, slightly surreal image of Towlie, High as Fuck, a massive, perpetually smiling, vaguely humanoid creature draped in a gigantic, shimmering, iridescent towel, floating in a hazy, purple-tinged underwater landscape. Heâ€™s holding a massive, frosted glass of liquid, with bubbles rising from it.  Detailed, vibrant colors, psychedelic, slightly disorienting, magical realism, inspired by Salvador Dali and Jim Hensons Creature from the Black Lagoon, 8k resolution.
