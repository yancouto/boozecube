A dramatic, aged illustration depicting a mischievous imp, Bruninho, grinning amidst a chaotic scene: a swirling vortex of sacrificed creatures (wolves, goblins), a crumbling stone tower being destroyed by a bolt of energy, and a single, newly summoned, hulking creature with menacing horns bursting forth with haste, all rendered in a slightly distressed, painterly style reminiscent of late 19th-century illustration, heavy on dark browns, greens, and reds, evocative of an old magic card.
