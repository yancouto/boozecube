A dramatic, swirling magical illustration of a shadowy imp, Bruninho, making a pact with a cracked, ancient altar, summoning bolts of chaotic energy and shattering a vibrant forest landscape, with a lone, sacrificed creature dissolving in a pool of dark magic, depicting the effects of the card – sacrifice, destruction, and the sudden appearance of a hasty, menacing creature – in a stylized, slightly chaotic art style.
