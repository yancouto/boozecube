A detailed, painterly illustration of a stout dwarf, Bromikon, wielding a small, ornate wooden ship-shaped board as a weapon, standing defiantly on a stormy sea, clearly favoring one side (left or right, indicated by a subtle swirl of water), with a crazed, intoxicated expression, surrounded by swirling waves and a faint, hazy blue glow, reminiscent of a pirate ship, in the style of a fantasy art piece.
