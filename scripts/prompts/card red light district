A dramatic, slightly chaotic illustration of a cobblestone street in a vividly red-lit, old-world district, overflowing with shadowy figures and flickering lanterns. A small, aged tavern-like land sits center, subtly glowing with red mana, with a slightly manic and distressed face. Style: gritty, detailed, old-world illustration, painterly, cinematic lighting.
