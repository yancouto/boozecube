A dynamic, cinematic illustration of a shadowy figure in a stylish, slightly steampunk-inspired workshop, pouring a shimmering, iridescent liquid – "Drink and Fly" – into a glass, while a magnificent, winged creature (a dragon or griffon) visibly weakens and staggers, clutching its head with a bewildered expression as the liquid drips onto it, magical energy crackling around the scene, dramatic lighting, detailed textures, fantasy art, vibrant colors, high resolution.
