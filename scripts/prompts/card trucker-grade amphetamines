A highly detailed, slightly gritty and vintage-style illustration of a colossal, rusted pickup truck overflowing with pills and vials of brightly colored liquid, bathed in a hazy, neon-lit desert sunset. The truck is partially submerged in a shimmering, swirling, psychedelic pool. A single, weary, intensely focused human face peers out from the driver's side window. Art old, 1970s style, psychedelic horror, magical realism.
