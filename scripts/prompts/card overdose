A stylized, slightly hazy illustration of a flamboyant, older man with wild hair and a brightly colored suit, reminiscent of Samuel L. Jackson from Pulp Fiction, dramatically gesturing towards a massive, oversized creature (like a dragon or behemoth) with a glowing aura. The background is a vibrant, swirling psychedelic color palette, with subtle bubbling effects and the text “I don’t go joypopping’ with bubblegummers” subtly overlaid. Art old, dramatic lighting, detailed textures.
