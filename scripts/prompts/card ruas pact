A dynamic, vibrant illustration of a swirling vortex of purple and teal energy, containing a stylized, spectral hand reaching out from the center, signing a pact with a glowing, ancient rune. In the background, shadowy silhouettes of creatures are being torn apart and resurrected, with a faint outline of a hand reaching into a deck. Magical particles and glowing runes surround the central figure, reflecting a sense of potent, controlled chaos.  Dramatic lighting and a painterly style, reminiscent of a classic fantasy illustration.
