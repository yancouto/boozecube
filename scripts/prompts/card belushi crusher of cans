A dynamic, full-color illustration of Belushi, Crusher of Cans, a muscular, grinning human fratboy wielding a giant, overflowing beer can as a weapon, surrounded by cheering, slightly inebriated figures, set in a smoky, 1940s-era dive bar, dramatic lighting, heroic pose, vibrant colors, art by Greg Rutkowski.
