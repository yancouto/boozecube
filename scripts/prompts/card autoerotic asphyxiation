Here are a few prompt options for Stable Diffusion, varying in detail and style, based on the "Autoerotic Asphyxiation" card description:

**Option 1 (Detailed & Dramatic):**

"A swirling, opulent aura of deep crimson and bruised purple surrounds a majestic, stylized dragon, its scales shimmering with a sickly sheen. The aura presses inwards, distorting the dragon's form, with a subtle, unsettling smile subtly visible in the dragon’s expression. Dramatic lighting, cinematic, dark fantasy, detailed, intricate, magical effect."

**Option 2 (Stylized & Evocative):**

“An aura of pulsing, suffocating roses and velvet, enveloping a magnificent griffon, its feathers darkening as it struggles against the binding magic.  Stylized, dark romanticism, ethereal, surreal, magical effect, dramatic composition."

**Option 3 (Simple & Conceptual):**

“A suffocating aura of deep red and black wraps around a powerful, armored warrior. The warrior's expression is one of resigned horror.  Dark fantasy, magical effect, dramatic lighting, atmospheric,  enchantment effect.”

**Option 4 (Short & Direct - good for quick iterations):**

"Suffocating aura, crimson and black, enveloping a powerful creature, magical enchantment, dramatic lighting, dark fantasy."

**Notes for using these prompts:**

*   **Negative Prompts:**  Consider adding negative prompts to steer the AI away from unwanted elements (e.g., "bright colors," "happy," "cartoonish").
*   **Sampling Steps & CFG Scale:** Experiment with these settings to find what produces the best results for your desired aesthetic.
*   **Seed:**  Use a fixed seed to control the generation and refine the image.

Would you like me to generate a prompt with a specific art style in mind (e.g., Art Nouveau, Steampunk, etc.)?
