A dynamic, gothic-inspired illustration of a hulking vampire, the "Chocula-Clan Vampire," drenched in a dark, viscous crimson liquid, standing amidst a crumbling, baroque castle interior. He's muscular and intimidating, with glowing red eyes, and a sinister grin. Blood drips from his fangs. Style: Detailed, dramatic lighting, reminiscent of classic horror illustrations, cinematic.
