Detailed, evocative art depicting a tarnished, ancient-looking metal hookah pipe, intricately decorated with swirling, hypnotic patterns. Wisps of smoky, purple vapor rise from it, subtly illuminating a shadowy figure (a hooded humanoid) drinking deeply from the hookah. The background is a dimly lit, opulent tavern interior with blurred figures and flickering candlelight, conveying a sense of decadent indulgence and constant card draw. Style: Detailed, slightly unsettling, inspired by dark fantasy illustration.
