A detailed, slightly surreal digital painting of a weary, middle-aged human police officer, clad in a slightly rumpled uniform, standing in a dimly lit, rain-slicked alleyway. He’s holding a small, glowing, grey “mediocre” counter and staring intently at a shadowy, indistinct figure entering the frame. The alley is filled with muted blues and greys, with a single, harsh spotlight illuminating the cop and the counter. Style: slightly painterly, with a touch of noir.
