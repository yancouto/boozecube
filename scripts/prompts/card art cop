A detailed, slightly surreal painting of a weary, middle-aged human police officer in a classic 1950s uniform, meticulously examining a small, slightly damaged miniature model of a dragon, a subtle "Mediocre" counter hovering nearby, with a world-weary expression and a cynical smirk, dramatic lighting, gritty textures, inspired by Norman Rockwell and Wayne Barlowe.
