A colossal, grotesque scorpion god, radiating primal fury, dominates a volcanic wasteland beneath a bruised, crimson sky. Jagged obsidian spikes erupt from its carapace, and venom drips from its fangs. It looms over a shattered, ancient city, a single, desperate human figure (silhouette only) attempting to fire a crossbow at the creature, engulfed in swirling, toxic smoke. Style: Dark fantasy, dramatic lighting, highly detailed textures, trending on ArtStation.
