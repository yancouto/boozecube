A highly detailed, unsettling illustration of two ghostly, pale teenage girls with vacant eyes, standing in a dimly lit, decaying diner. One girl holds a dripping milkshake, the other a shattered glass.  A single cup counter glows faintly on the girl with the milkshake.  Art style: Old, painterly, reminiscent of early 20th-century horror illustration â€“ muted colors, dramatic shadows, unsettlingly realistic details.
