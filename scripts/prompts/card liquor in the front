A dramatic, slightly hazy illustration in the style of a 1970s poker game, depicting a grizzled, older man with a mischievous grin leaning over a table strewn with cards and overflowing whiskey glasses, with several fantastical, slightly intoxicated creatures (like a miniature dragon and a grinning imp) surrounding him, evoking a sense of reckless abandon and sudden card draw, m15-mainframe-dfc style, detailed, vibrant colors, 1970s aesthetic.
