A dynamic and unsettling illustration of a thick, viscous, sickly green ooze - "Racist Slime" - erupting from a cracked, volcanic landscape. The ooze is partially formed into a grotesque humanoid face with jagged teeth, and dripping with corrupted magic symbols. The background shows shattered, ancient ruins, with shadowy figures fleeing in terror. Magical energy crackles around the slime, and a sickly green glow emanates from it. Style: Dark fantasy, unsettling, painterly, detailed texture, dramatic lighting.
