Here's a Stable Diffusion prompt based on the Magic The Gathering card description, aiming for a detailed and evocative image reflecting the "Bordeaux" swamp land with the illustrated style of sasasasa:

**"A lush, dark swamp landscape dominated by a deep burgundy-colored swamp, swirling with viscous, ruby-red liquid, reflecting the light of a distant, hazy moon. Twisted, gnarled cypress trees drip with this 'Bordeaux' liquid, and in the center, a weathered, stone altar pulses with the same color. Style: detailed fantasy art, sasasasa illustration, moody lighting, saturated colors, magic the gathering card art."**

**Explanation of choices:**

*   **Detailed Fantasy Art:** Sets the overall tone and style.
*   **Sasasasa Illustration:** Explicitly references the illustrator's style.
*   **Descriptive Language:**  "Lush, dark swamp," "ruby-red liquid," "gnarled cypress trees" creates a strong visual.
*   **Action/Effect:** "Swirling with liquid" hints at the card's effect.
*   **"Magic The Gathering Card Art":**  Further guides the AI to produce an appropriate image format.

Would you like me to refine the prompt further based on a specific aesthetic you're aiming for (e.g., more realistic, more painterly, more stylized)?
