A dramatic, painterly illustration of a grizzled, spectral pirate captain – "The Captain Was Here" – looming over a fearsome, ancient sea serpent, both radiating a blue, ethereal light. The serpent is partially enveloped in a shimmering, aged nautical rope aura. Style: Rum. It’s what’s for dinner,  old art, cinematic lighting, detailed textures, magical realism.
