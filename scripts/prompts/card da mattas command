Here's a Stable Diffusion prompt based on the provided Magic: The Gathering card description, aiming for a detailed and evocative image:

**"A dynamic, horizontal-oriented Magic: The Gathering card art depicting Da Matta, a towering, spectral figure wreathed in swirling blue and black energy, raising a crystalline hand to command.  Around him, shimmering illusions of destruction and countered spells coalesce, with a focused, intense gaze.  Subtle hints of a battlefield chaos in the background, suggesting multiple targets affected by his command. Dramatic lighting, detailed textures, atmospheric effects, vibrant colors, Magic: The Gathering style."**

**Notes on why this prompt was constructed:**

*   **Horizontal Orientation:** Explicitly requests a horizontal card format.
*   **Da Matta Description:**  Details the core visual element - Da Matta's appearance.
*   **Effects:**  Captures the card's multiple effects with evocative language ("swirling energy," "illusions of destruction and countered spells").
*   **Dramatic Lighting & Atmosphere:**  Adds to the sense of power and grandeur.
*   **Style:**  Specifies "Magic: The Gathering style" to guide the AI.
