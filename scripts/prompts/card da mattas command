A dynamic, cinematic illustration of a stern, ancient Egyptian scribe – Da Matta – wielding a glowing, stylized staff that emits bolts of blue and black energy. He’s surrounded by swirling sand and echoing hieroglyphs, casting a dramatic light on a targeted, crumbling stone statue (representing a nonland permanent) and a countering hand. Two cards burst from his hand, depicting a player taking a 'shot' with a hand, and a visually striking, shimmering effect symbolizes card draw. Dramatic lighting, high detail, cinematic, magic the gathering art style, horizontal card layout.
