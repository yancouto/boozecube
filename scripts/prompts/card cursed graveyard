A dramatic, slightly stylized illustration of a crumbling graveyard at twilight, illuminated by a flickering torch and overflowing with spectral, ghostly figures. A shadowy figure in a dark coat stands at the edge, holding a stylized goblet, casting a sickly green glow. Numerous ghostly creatures with shimmering redemption counters float around, some returning to life with a ghostly shimmer.  Dark, moody colors, intricate details, fantasy art, Magic The Gathering card.
