A dynamic, painterly illustration of a powerfully built, grizzled Dwarf warrior, the Mead-Hall Captain, standing amidst a boisterous, smoke-filled mead hall, wielding a battleaxe, surrounded by three freshly summoned 1/1 red Dwarf creature tokens, with a defiant expression and a vibrant, slightly blurry background of revelers and ale, in the style of a classic Magic The Gathering card art.
