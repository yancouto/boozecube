A vibrant, stylized Magic: The Gathering card art depicting a jovial, slightly tipsy Bruninho (a small, cartoonish humanoid figure) mid-action – perhaps chugging a beer, taking a shot, or gesturing wildly – set within a fantastical, Genevensis-inspired landscape filled with swirling magical energy and miniature taverns, rendered in a detailed, slightly chaotic style with a focus on color and movement, resembling a genevensis-10-saga card.
