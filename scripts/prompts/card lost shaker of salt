A whimsical, slightly chaotic illustration depicting a grizzled, vaguely humanoid merfolk figure – perhaps resembling a weathered sailor – holding a tarnished, ornate shaker overflowing with glittering salt. The merfolk is mid-gesture, seemingly throwing the salt towards a hapless human figure doubled over in agony, a look of profound regret on their face. Style: Old master painting, dramatic lighting, detailed textures, slightly unsettling, muted color palette.
