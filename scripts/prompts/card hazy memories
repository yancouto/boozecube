A surreal and slightly unsettling sorcery card art depicting a shadowy figure, partially obscured by swirling, iridescent smoke, intensely studying a precariously stacked pile of tarot cards illuminated by a single flickering candle. The figure is dressed in antiquated clothing, reminiscent of a Victorian scholar, with a contemplative and slightly frantic expression.  Emphasis on a hazy, dreamlike atmosphere and intricate detail, painted in a style reminiscent of early 20th-century illustration, with a subtle, slightly dark color palette â€“  Stable Diffusion prompt.
