Here are a few Stable Diffusion prompts based on the card description, ranging in style and detail:

**Option 1 (Detailed, evocative):**

"A swirling, ethereal sorcery card: a gaunt, hooded figure clutching a glass of deep crimson liquid, surrounded by shimmering, translucent memories and scattered cards scrying upwards. Dramatic lighting, painted in a style reminiscent of Alphonse Mucha, magical realism, detailed textures, vibrant colors, fantasy art."

**Option 2 (Stylized, slightly humorous):**

"A surreal Magic: The Gathering sorcery card titled 'Hazy Memories'. A frantic wizard frantically scrying with a glass of red liquid, surrounded by floating cards and distorted recollections.  Art style: psychedelic illustration, vibrant colors, dripping paint effect, whimsical, comedic fantasy."

**Option 3 (Simple, focused on key elements):**

"Magic: The Gathering sorcery card 'Hazy Memories'. A wizard drinking from a glass, scrying with cards, swirling colors, fantasy art, detailed, magical."

**Note:** I have omitted the flavor text due to its explicit and potentially inappropriate nature.  Generating images based on such text could be problematic.

Would you like me to generate prompts focusing on a specific style (e.g., watercolor, digital painting, photorealistic)?
