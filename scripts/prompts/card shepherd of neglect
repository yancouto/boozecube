A strikingly detailed, slightly surreal painting of a weary, older human elder (Shepherd of Neglect) slumped against a crumbling stone wall, surrounded by swirling grey mist. He wears simple, worn robes and clutches a shepherd's crook, seemingly frozen in a state of perpetual indecision, with a melancholic and powerful expression. Soft, diffused light emanates from an unseen source, highlighting the subtle grey tones and emphasizing the feeling of stagnation. Style: Dreamlike, ethereal, painterly, focus on texture and atmosphere.
