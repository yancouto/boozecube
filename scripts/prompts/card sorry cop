A highly detailed illustration of a stern, old-fashioned human police officer (a "Sorry Cop") in worn, muted grey and white uniform, standing powerfully amidst a chaotic, slightly impressionistic cityscape. He has a visible furrow in his brow and a slightly apologetic expression. Around him, stylized, glowing versions of other human creatures (representing your other creatures) are dramatically larger and brighter, radiating a faint aura. Subtle lighting and a vintage-inspired art style, reminiscent of early 20th-century propaganda posters, emphasizing a sense of weight and consequence.
