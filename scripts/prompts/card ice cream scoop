Here's a Stable Diffusion prompt based on the provided Magic The Gathering card description, aiming for a somewhat chaotic and humorous style:

**"A melting, dripping ice cream scoop artifact, rendered in a frenetic, slightly unsettling art style reminiscent of Your Mom’s chaotic artwork – vibrant blues and pinks, exaggerated textures, dripping ice cream, a vaguely threatening expression on the scoop itself, with a blurred background of someone frantically chugging a beer, dramatic lighting, highly detailed, psychedelic, unsettling humor."**

I've tried to capture the card's tone – the absurdity, the threat, and the slightly disturbing illustration style suggested by the "Your Mom" illustrator.  It aims for a visually striking and memorable image.
