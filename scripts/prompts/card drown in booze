A swirling, hazy tavern scene at night, illuminated by flickering candlelight, overflowing with drunken, monstrous figures – goblins, orcs, and trolls – all slumped over tables, spilling ale, with a towering, spectral figure (a translucent, sorrowful ghost) looming above them, casting a sickly green glow, dramatic lighting, detailed textures, magical realism, dark fantasy, style of Greg Rutkowski.
