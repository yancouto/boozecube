A dynamic, stylized illustration of Juan, the Mind Smasher, a powerful green planeswalker with a fierce expression, standing amidst swirling green energy, surrounded by a chaotic scene of miniature, writhing green worm tokens and disoriented opponents drinking from mugs, rendered in an old-school, slightly gritty Magic The Gathering art style, reminiscent of a 1990s M15 card, with a focus on dramatic lighting and vibrant colors.
