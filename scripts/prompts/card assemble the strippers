A dynamic, slightly chaotic illustration of a swirling, ornate enchantment card titled "Assemble the Strippers," depicting shadowy, vaguely humanoid figures (the "Strippers") emerging from the card's surface, illuminated with flickering red and black light, overlaid with swirling gears and mechanical details, reminiscent of a Grand Prix Las Vegas 2013 style, emphasizing movement and a sense of urgency.
