A vibrant, slightly worn illustration depicting a cozy, brightly lit 1994 local game store, overflowing with players engrossed in Magic: The Gathering, with a shadowy, grinning figure (a vaguely humanoid form) offering a trade involving dual lands and a Shivan Dragon, emphasizing a sense of playful negotiation and nostalgia, painted in a style reminiscent of classic Magic art with a touch of comic book shading.
