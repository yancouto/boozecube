A breathtaking, panoramic illustration of a colossal, snow-dusted landmass shaped like a whimsical Christmas village, shimmering with multicolored mana symbols and overflowing with festive lights, a central, ancient tree pulsing with magical energy, detailed with intricate clockwork mechanisms and tiny, joyful sprites, painted in a style reminiscent of Alphonse Mucha with a touch of Studio Ghibli, hyperdetailed, epic scale, fantasy art.
