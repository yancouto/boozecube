Here are a few prompt options for Stable Diffusion, varying in style and detail, based on the card description:

**Option 1 (Detailed & Thematic - leaning into the "drink 2" aspect):**

"A dynamic painting of a flamboyant, slightly tipsy, genie-like figure named Brizei, pouring iridescent liquid from a shimmering goblet into the face of a bewildered wizard, magical energy swirling around them, dramatic lighting, vibrant colors, Magic The Gathering card art, detailed, ornate background,  fantasy illustration."

**Option 2 (Stylized & Concise):**

"Brizei, a mischievous genie, spilling rainbow liquid onto a spellcaster, Magic The Gathering instant card art, stylized, colorful, fantasy illustration, dynamic pose."

**Option 3 (Simple & Clean):**

"Brizei, a genie, pouring a shimmering liquid, Magic The Gathering instant card art, simple, bold colors, fantasy illustration."

**Key elements considered for all prompts:**

*   **Brizei:**  Explicitly names the card's character.
*   **Genie/Tipsy:**  Captures the essence of the card's description.
*   **Magic The Gathering:**  Specifies the art style.
*   **Instant:** (Implied through the art style).
*   **Color Palette:** Suggests vibrant, magical colors.

To help me refine the prompt even further, could you tell me:

*   What kind of overall aesthetic are you aiming for (e.g., realistic, painterly, cartoonish, etc.)?
