A dramatic, slightly chaotic scene depicting a young, bewildered wizard mid-stutter, frantically casting an instant â€“ "Did I Stutter!?". Around him, swirling temporal distortions and fractured reflections of spells resolve, a creature momentarily gains haste, and a hand reaches for a new card.  Old-fashioned illustration style, slightly blurred and distressed, reminiscent of a 19th-century magical painting.
