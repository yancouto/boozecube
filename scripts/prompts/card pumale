A whimsical, slightly aged illustration of a muscular, ginger tabby cat (Pumale) mid-leap, mid-drink from a frosty beer stein, with a determined expression. Background is a hazy, slightly blurred tavern scene with dimly lit tables and patrons.  Art style: painterly, reminiscent of early 20th-century illustration, detailed textures, warm colors, evocative of Chocolate Mouseâ€™s style.
