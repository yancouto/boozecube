A highly detailed, stylized illustration of a colossal, shimmering blue and silver fish-like construct – Tinfins – dominating a turbulent, swirling ocean. The construct is armored with intricate, gear-like plating and glowing runes. It’s mid-attack, teeth bared, with waves crashing around it, illuminated by ethereal blue energy. Dramatic lighting, art old style, magic the gathering card art.
