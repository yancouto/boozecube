A detailed, slightly humorous illustration of a jovial Elf Fratboy named "Dealer of the Dorms," standing amidst a chaotic dorm room filled with scattered books, empty pizza boxes, and overflowing beer bottles. He's holding a miniature, ornate deck of cards with a confident grin, casting a radiant white light as he creates a 2/2 Pledge creature token.  The style should evoke a slightly stylized, illustrative look, leaning towards a vibrant and energetic feel â€“ think "vintage Magic" aesthetic.
