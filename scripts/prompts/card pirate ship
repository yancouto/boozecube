A detailed, painterly illustration of a weathered blue pirate ship token creature, reminiscent of an m15-mainframe style, standing proudly on a misty ocean, waves gently lapping against its hull, a single, dramatic spotlight illuminating it, with subtle "m15-mainframe" style overlays and a distressed, aged aesthetic, emphasizing the "Islandhome" and "T: Pirate Ship" abilities, art old, Arrrr, matey.
