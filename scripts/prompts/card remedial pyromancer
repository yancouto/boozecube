A highly detailed, slightly unsettling illustration of a young, intoxicated human wizard—the Remedial Pyromancer—casting a single, flickering red flame. He’s slightly hunched over, eyes glazed, with a manic grin. The background is a dimly lit, chaotic workshop filled with bubbling potions and strange devices. Style: slightly painterly, reminiscent of classic fantasy illustration with a touch of surrealism, dramatic lighting, red and orange color palette.
