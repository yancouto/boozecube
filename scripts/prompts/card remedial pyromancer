A highly detailed, slightly unsettling painting of a young, intoxicated human wizard – the Remedial Pyromancer – with wild eyes and clutching a small, flickering flame, surrounded by a hazy, chaotic burst of orange and red fire, reminiscent of a Victorian-era illustration with a touch of surreal horror, dramatic lighting, intricate textures, magic, arcane, unsettling, reminiscent of Chandra Nalaar.
