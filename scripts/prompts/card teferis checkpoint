A highly detailed, slightly weathered artifact card illustration depicting a bronze, clockwork-like device resembling a stylized hourglass, resting on a stone pedestal.  Around the hourglass, ethereal purple mist swirls, subtly obscuring several small, drowsy-looking creatures (wolves, bears) being held in place by glowing chains.  The style is reminiscent of classic Magic art from the early 2000s, with a focus on intricate detail and atmospheric lighting, emphasizing a sense of temporal manipulation and magical containment â€“ 1W/U artifact, old art style.
