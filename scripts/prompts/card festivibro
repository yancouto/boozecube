A dynamic, slightly stylized illustration of a stout, bearded dwarf (Fratboy subtype) named Festivibro, surrounded by swirling beer foam and celebrating with raised tankards. He’s charging forward with five pint counters glowing around him, while other dwarves and creatures in the background excitedly add +1/+1 counters to themselves as he passes, with a hazy, joyful tavern scene in the background – vibrant colors, ale-stained wood, and a sense of boisterous celebration. 2W casting cost visible subtly in the corner.
