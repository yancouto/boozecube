	rule_text: If you would lose the game, you may chug a beer or take a shot instead. If you do, exile <atom-cardname><nospellcheck>this artifact</nospellcheck></atom-cardname> and sacrifice all nonland permanents you control and shuffle your hand and graveyard into your library. Draw five cards, set your life total to twenty, and remove any poison counters you have.
