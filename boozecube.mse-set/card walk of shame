		Whenever a creature deals damage to you, put a shame counter on it.
		Creatures with shame counters don’t untap during their controller’s untap step.
		At the beginning of each player’s upkeep, that player may remove any number of shame counters from creatures that he or she controls and drink 4 or each counter removed this way.
