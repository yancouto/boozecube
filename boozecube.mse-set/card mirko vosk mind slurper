		Whenever <atom-cardname><nospellcheck>Mirko Vosk, Mind Slurper</nospellcheck></atom-cardname> deals combat damage to a player, you must make “slurping” sounds while that player reveals cards from the top of their library until 2 lands are revealed. That player drinks for each card revealed, then puts those cards in their graveyard.
